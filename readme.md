Howdy stranger!

This is sort of supposed to be a private repository of all the stuff I've learned. But apparently, people discovered this, so here's a short guide of what's around here. I mostly use these folders/files:

- current: my current stuff to do, changes pretty much daily
- gems: really, really cool pages, that explains things so damn well. Also a bunch of pop culture stuff that I like
- technical_references/: a lot of technical stuff. I learned a lot of stuff, but forgets them often too. So these files are supposed to give me my memory back in 10 minutes about a subject

Also, at midnight local time, everything is automatically commited and pushed. Script file is at `autoPush.sh`, and cron tab is `0 0 * * * ~/logs/autoPush.sh>>~/cron.log 2>>~/cron.log`
