i have no idea how any of these work and this is not my area of expertise

internet merchant account
payment gateway (worldpay, sage pay), sends to payment processor (whose is this?), then money from customer bank to your account
payment service provider (hosts frontend pages, offer a list of payment schemes to choose from)

paypal

"online marketplace"

may be set up a patrion account to test the flow of money?
