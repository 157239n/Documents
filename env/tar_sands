Places:
- Russia
- Venezuela
- US
- Canada, 170.2 bil barrels, 11% global reserves, 1.9 mil barrels a day. Total oil (from other sources) transported to US is 2.6 mil barrel, leaked into Athabasca River

But really, the main players are only Alberta (Canada, Syncruse mine) and Venezuela

Composition:
- bitumen, fancy name for the oil
- sand
- water

Can't directly pump, because bitumen is so viscous. Other methods are introduced:
- Open-pit mining: shallow, <75m
- In-situ: pump steam to kinda liquidfy the bitumen and then it can be pumped upwards

Send mixture to heated water then the bitumen is released from the sand
