Why Bother: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-lede-t.html
This is actually the best piece in my opinion, that it has tried its best to convince people to follow their footsteps. It actually outlined a very real psychological problem of depending on the experts.

But like, again, this is still wishing upon a star that things will work out well, and that is a terrible, terrible strategy. The efforts needed to put in will be enormous, and I don't think it will affect much. Because there has always been environmentalist's attempt, so much in fact that today, it's kinda just blurring out, and people get tired of it.

Also, I'm having that cheap energy mind. And I believe that it will reap benefits. But, if the carrying capacity is lower than what's needed then it will not be ever a solution.

And also, how the hell are we going to go forward with all of our technology in the coming decades without getting deeper entrenched into our own specialty?

Also great article, especially that last sentence "the backbone of Germany is about to bend. Now you tell me again, don't panic?", https://cleantechnica.com/2019/02/10/to-all-german-automakers-believe-me-you-are-still-sleeping/
