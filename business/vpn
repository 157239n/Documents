Current server information

5 servers = $25/month

1:
- NY, reroutes 80 to server 4's 22
- also stuff like general applications
2 (not operational):
- NY, for deployment for US customers
3:
- Singapore, for deployment for asian customers
4:
- staging for PMI
5 (not operational):
- NY, for wildest things possible and bleeding development. If stable enough then move to server 2. Good thing to note that each deployment will be placed in a docker container

so the great thing about docker-compose is that you can actually just quickly turn off an app, then recreate everything and turn back on quite quickly. I mean, I can use phpstorm.u4.kelvinho.org as a testing bed for stuff like phpunit, then if I want to shut it down, just do so and then replace it with the local magento environment. Nothing is lost. And I got documentation from magento's Dockerfile too. All the configs are there already, so all in all pretty awesome.
