these are from my exploration of kali linux. I've actually decided that the field is too large and I will have to dedicate every time and effort into this to really reap the benefits, so it's not worth it anyway

security audit/pen testing steps:
- monitor DNS changes
- scan internet-facing networks everyday
- scan internal vulnerability
- configuration scans
- active directory reporting
- end user security test, meaning sitting with the user and see what he/she does
- firewall logging anomaly detection
- read reports from these tests
- disable su
- verify sudoers
- analyze services that start on boot
- review cron for all users
- scan for world-writable files
- scan for files owned by unknown users/groups
- verify pam.d files are configured as desired
- globally disable access to xml-rpc.php in apache config (403, helps prevent brute force and other quiet attacks)
- go through a list of all TLS ciphers and make sure all suites are strong enough
- prepare a usb stick with kali linux
- use a standard security Framework such as NIST, ISO 27001, or SOC2 to get the right information
