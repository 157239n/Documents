So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- (done) Learn about the remaining IT stuff: Docker and Gradle
- (low priority) Learn about networking and possibly wiggle around the Raspberry Py to understand more
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN

So what's the carrying capacity for the human race?

Now it kinda feels the whole field is a bit toxic, because like, it appears that we have exceeded our carrying capacity and further advocacy might as well tank the world's economy

green new deal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxIDJWCbk6I

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Also understand the perspective of a climate scientists doing these things too. Examples would be Hayhoe (obvious), Laura Iraci, Rama Nemani, Matthew Hansen
Thomas Friedman
Susan Rice, us national security advisor

Also see the process of how oil refineries work, how pumpjacks work to the point as if I'm visiting it. Do the same for those industries that I care so much about, like ethanol, steel and cement. Do the same for a solar plant like Andasol.

I guess I wanted to learn about automation is to know if I can build my own factory/plant. If I can, and if I know how professional stuff are done there, I can out source it effectively, and at the same time manage the money flow too.

Also see how can solar panels are mass produced, what are the remaining challenges, (or any). Also see whether it will solve the electricity problem in full (meaning I can clearly see a path, and measure progress on that path) as I thought it would. If not then I'll have to reevaluate my plan

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year

How about the science left to do with Lithium and Lithium ion batteries?

And again, look into creating several startup types, one being manufacturing, one being industrial, one being web service, one being biochemical engineering.

Familiarize myself with permits and environmental regulations that are floating around in the world right now.

To understand the supply chain and how can I affect it, look for ways to mitigate palm oil.

"climate change without bullshit". Important article to go through: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/climate-change-global-warming-scenarios-ambition

Dig into the quick history of human kind. Possibly watching Origins again

Kickstarter: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7lzqyo/anyone_have_experience_with_kickstarter_tips/

Also intro to family planning and those kind of stuff.

In light of drawdown, how about I discuss it with a lot of people, hold conferences at many different places and also change the textbook?

get into the mining and petrochemical industry. Also play satisfactory to begin to appreciate the size of these industrial machines, also the interconnections between them. https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/satisfactory/home. Did so, but it seems like this view of full automation is kind of misleading, because in the real world, we do not have the freedom of picking up factories and ploping them down. We have a preconceived idea of how the factory is structured, how things move in and out, and there is typically only 1 main assembling line. Other improvements are about efficiency, speed-wise. So it's really, really different from the type of scaling in satisfactory or in factorio.

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

archicad

what's the deal with hadoop

oh wow, this is such a gem about manufacturing and prototyping: https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-parts-injection-molding

okay, so I got the heavy industries down. I know what machines are there, how do these pieces fit together. Now see the same for the semiconductor industry, and what's the deal with all of those substrates, the doping and the etching? Also how metal working works, and how foundaries work too. For this, may be look for yt channels like king of random or night hawk

some recycling stats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxaN_xqQh4

so I guess what I wanted to do about climate through all of these investigation might be giving out suggestions to improve stuff

Manufacturing:
- "reddit industrial machine design process"
- I still don't know how to build a factory from scratch tho, so still make an effort to dig into it
- also should I get involved in the manufacturing business?
- also what software do they use for monitoring automated stuff? Probably a course in automation will do it
- profile sinarmas
- also how oil products are refined
- how electricity in industrial systems work?

also see over how public talking works, what venues I can penetrate into

how waste management works
also how to futureproof myself
how to contract out for a whole factory?
so the guts of mechanical engineering is to be damn precise and to be rigid

go over android again, also how bluetooth works on that gig a year ago

about the climate stuff. What resources do I have an infinite amount of that I can rely on? I have been taking electricity for granted

may be getting back into the finite element analysis thing if I have time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txk-VO1hzBY

also read on structures of revolutions
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

read the 14 pages of the green new deal
also metals scarcity seems to be a thing too. So dig into that
the art of not being governed: an anarchist history of upland southeast asia, james scott

Global climate action summit (9 hours long summit lol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxHDD_pLf0
also go through all of practical engineering to get the feel for the field
so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also, may be go over really quickly the economic vids on khan academy, they have a lot of content and possibly gems that I can utilize

and then finish the freakonomics book. Why do I feel like that book is kinda more anecdotal and won't actually introduce to the big picture.

what's the deal with chemtrails?

how water works, mesopotamia, 691 BCE

how about something like factorio, but much deeper, requiring much more effort, containing a lot more content. But this time it will be simpler. I'm imagining something like an industry simulator

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

International Sea Level Institute.
Sanan Sino-Science, chinese comp that plant trees in doors, price 11 times higher than the market average. No pescitides needed, and not much water needed too

Also dig into hydroponics and aquaponics

again, I feel that econ stuff is so "floating". I don't know where their absolute zero is. But I suspect that no one actually know how it works and just follow with the flow. Also, spend some time writing about how problems in Factorio differ from logistic problems in real life

Again, try to make an ASIC, application specific integrated circuits. Try to get myself to the cutting edge of these circuits and systems.

write a post explaining the complexities of gradle together with CI/CD and docker, and compare that to the financial infrastructure of today. Also related is how all of these abstractions are just to deal with the shear scale of things we have built our civilization with. But really, the roots of everything is really, really simple. Also mention the mind-blowing abstractions of things like first-order functions.
may be this is more about abstraction more, and a shadow of it: modernization

- reality check on renewables

go through this, and consider this done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE

ethical hacking, 15 hours: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE

also I feel like I need to study physics rigorously now, with the state of mind that I've got

https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html

so, applications:
- that ocr thing with nutritional value (lmao, and make it quick). Also for money stuff
- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- try out google genomics
- see how the folks who aggregate together a bunch of forest data did it
- see how the folks who aggregate together a bunch of earthquake data did it
- then the story of energy

plow through android once more, to get the philosophy and the way of doing things

also what's the deal with peer to peer networks

- read more about how these molecules are formed, then simulate that

talks on rendering:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdN06E6Xn9E
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2KTRn4BMI

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

with the forces in check, see if I can simulate beams being stressed

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

methane stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62VXwjT-csQ

and try out what happens with lidar stuff? How to integrate them?

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also I still don't get the interface for climate change. I mean, the common technical language ppl talk with each other in the field, so dig into that.

wtf is this https://americas.ramboll.com/projects

how about that world science festival thing brian greene hosted

see the interface between python and other data packages, how the interfaces work

the simulations, implement locality with hashmap stuff

Then read over those 2000 pages magento, then understand the existing apis for the big picture.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

simulate boyles law for chi, and the sterling engine where air is forced on the side. Also think about how would you do forces on a beam. Do this, or a collab with her is impossible.

stocks again, check out docs for robinhood

seems nice, go over wp over here: https://www.youtube.com/user/MattGeri/playlists. Again, the point of all this is to be able to port over kuche. Once I've done that then no need to go over wp. But may be watch the original series once more, to get the intuition behind that.

buy chi and dan some stuff from spacex store

and, learn nodejs in a few hours so I can sort of show dan what's that about. Seems like dan's not really following my path, and she kinda just want things serendipitously, and that's okay too. And by doing this, hopefully I can be comfortable in adapting to new tech really fast and deploy these things even faster. But again, goddammit, I still need to understand the firmware interface.

may be don't learn node as before, but understand the technology, what is the advantage in using it, and the philosophy behind it.

save the path I laid out for that yt guy for chi, and reply to that person too

after I have understood networking, return to that stack overflow question of mine and answer that question

oh and go through the old networking series, then go through the tcp/ip illustrated book once more, to gather nuggets of information, not to understand and remember how these packet format works.

read over digitalocean's terms of service, to get the feel for legal stuff: https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/

see over chi's new lab reports and understand the chemistry she's currently involved in.

also, how about porting kuche over the ny server, to make development much less painful, then just port it back to singapore, to improve performance over there. This will also give me insight into deploying these serendipitously, and to truely utilize what docker has to offer. So, u3 will contain the business-critical code for the website, and u2 will run the email servers. Because I am not serving this through a proxy, the chance for failure is less, because I don't really have to take down apache for new certificates and whatnot. Also now that multiple email domains seems possible, do the same thing with kelvinho.org and see whether I can replicate everything. And the problem with persistent state too. Understand the image and the procedure fully, to make sure there are no surprises, and that I can repeat everything here reliably. Then for the website thing, test out whether just deleting the entry in the hosts file will make windows utilize the backbone dns or there are some hidden caches that I don't know about. A way to test this is to basically find a tool to tracert dns, or enter an invalid ip address for kuche, then removing it and if it updates, then it's probably good to go. No wait, a sneaky programmer can still bypass that. So, checking that is on the way to making sure everything works for the demo, but is not entirely foolproof.

play factorio again, but this time try to skip all the bullshit, and just aim the goal really sharp and finish it quick

an interesting challenge that I think will be in the right step to understand the true solutions to climate change would be to do the terraformed mars thing, or at least look into casey's work and figure out how it works. Then use the data available for earthquakes and other stuff like tree tops, aggregated from satellites and whatnot to visualize and put together all of these data.

also a friendly reminder that there is still a lot of stuff and opened pages on the phone. But these after entirely fixing kuche's problems.

also a problem with money and law that I think I need to solve is that currently I'm kinda not using the legal library as the rest of the world. I need to know the details, to be aware of the parameters that introduces

may be make the daily graph scrollable week by week. I think I'm crazy but I think I can actually implement this tonight.

Also figure out migrations too, so that the old viruses can still be effective. Then I can sort of know what it's like to do actual migrations

Then after polishing the concurrent aspect of the virus, and have written about the structure of the virus, then I think I can understand the philosophy of magento in its entirety.

also i'm lucky that I don't sort of have to deal with zero downtime upgrades. But wait, how would I do that? The guideline I saw on the internet is to just have multiple private servers, then use the load balancer to distribute load between them. Nice. But like databases man. How do you replicate something like that?
