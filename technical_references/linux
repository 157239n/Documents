"inetd is the service that kinda listens to all of the sockets and relay that to other layers. Worked well before the internet happened"
"So this leads us to what we know these days as service. It's kinda a super set of a daemon. They often encompasses multiple daemons or a whole bunch of clones of a daemon or various things like that. Old school init can start these things but they don't really get involved with managing them after that."
"... housekeeping functions like ... mounting filesystems, and starting daemons"

non interactive pre seeding (debian-based only): https://serverfault.com/questions/143968/automate-the-installation-of-postfix-on-ubuntu
- debconf-set-selections <<< "postfix postfix/mailname string your.hostname.com"
- debconf-set-selections <<< "postfix postfix/main_mailer_type string 'Internet Site'"

Editing runlevel startup daemons:
- disable daemon: update-rc.d apache2 disable
- remove daemon files completely (and the service too): update-rc.d -f apache2 remove

binding ssh to a specific interface:
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

each service is represented by a service unit described by a service file shipped in
- /lib/systemd/system
- /run/systemd/system
- /etc/systemd/system
overwrites each other, with structure {service name}.service.d/*.conf, but what I saw is a whole mess of other stuff

daemons:
- virtualization
  - libvirtd
  - spice-vdagentd
  - ovmf
- network
  - systemd-networkd
  - systemd-resolved
  - networking

filesystem:
etc
  hosts, use service nscd restart
  hosts.deny
  hosts.allow
  environment, environment for all processes, be injected into all user sessions thanks to Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)
  network
    interfaces, interfaces at boot time
  shells, valid login shells
dev
  stdin
  urandom
  null
  bus
usr
  share
