- read rocket propulsion elements
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.

can RL agents always be reasonable when framerate switches to 30fps to 60 or higher? If they are influenced by this then it seems like the error signal attenuation still applies right? So at that point, why not just create a much simpler policy-only optimization process?

also, pay very, very close attention to human's failure modes as well, as I don't think this has been developed in the community yet

again x3, I think I can implement this whole thing without the formulation of action-state values or state values. So try out that kind of simple tree search. Also I think by creating all of the infrastructure on my own, I can really provide a new perspective in the game

also see how humans actually do RL too. How can they correlate long distance reward signals? Are they even good at such a task? It seems like I can somehow use attention as this mechanism that spans multiple time frames, so as to make the RL capabilities more pronounced, as that acts kinda like a skip connection

so the model-based RL agents seems interesting, because it can do fundamental experiments in the world to build an accurate model, then use that model as a proxy for the real world, then do experiments on them, instead of on the real world

do the predicting distances by being consistent thingy, because it's a real possibility that may reveal more what's really going on

again, why don't ppl include loss surface visualizations in their papers??? I think this is absolutely necessary to actually gain an intuition of what's going on

attention and its relation to event-based systems?

so the idea GPT-3 is pushing is that when the big network gets fed a prompt, it forms this little network on the go that's specialized to handle the task, which sort of explains why GPT-3 needs to be so big, and it also sort of explains the power-law relationship. So really reason about the relative sizes of these networks. How large is the actual specialized network and the full one? Then make comparisons to other animals

also yeah, we already have the A100 GPU, which can do like 600 TFLOPS, more than the human brain already. But the training still takes time tho, because what we're effectively doing is getting the general architecture to pass through billions of years of evolution, so it makes sense that it takes so long and consuming so many resources. But humans learn new things pretty slowly too, which sort of tells us that in learning completely new things, humans take as long as GPT-3. So have numbers to characterize this phenomenon

history ppt:
- eliza, futile attempts, example of "symbolic AI". Then the whole expert systems. Mention the brittleness of it
- then checkers, proving out RL and markov chains
- then classic brute force of gary kasparov
- MNIST benchmark, LeNet, Yann LeCun, first important demonstration that the connectionist view actually works. Also proving that convs also works
- ImageNet benchmark, a concrete benchmark, 1k labels, 10M images
- AlexNet, first breakthrough by Alex Krizhevsky & Ilya Sutskever, which blows everyone out of the water. Implementation is so simple too
- ResNet, huge breakthrough in proving deep systems work, and introduce an idea that deeper is indeed better, and don't have diminishing returns. Also impact on loss landscape is amazing
- attention is all you need. Seemingly don't have a ceiling. The bigger you go, the better it gets
- so, ppl have been making it bigger, and consistently get bigger returns. GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT, and results are absolutely amazing
- returning back to RL, there's the alphago stuff. The impact is that now it can teach us instead of deepblue. Also it can be very creative

path from now? Short and long term goals?

long term goal is to be able to:
- show others where is this technology at, what can be done with it, how to think about our future and how to be prepared for it
- understand more about how the brain actually works
- apply image supervised learning in all other domains
- do research on my own with language models
- apply collaborative filtering and dealing with tabular data at scale, and active learning too
- paragraph recognition
- object recognition
- do research on RL
- accurately model physics

short term goal is to:
- read over all papers currently, which is quite a lot
- do all brilliant stuff (by this week)
- do all jeremy howard stuff
- do a few kaggle stuff
- redo scales on the brain capacity thingy, and create a gpu and performance guide for ppl who're into training stuff (actually measure my GPU performance)
- warn teachers of GPT-3, create an interface to automatically generate scripts to amaze them

https://medium.com/dataseries/google-deepminds-dreamer-is-a-reinforcement-learning-agent-that-can-solve-long-horizon-tasks-5faa6f6b63b
https://singularityhub.com/2020/07/26/deepminds-newest-ai-programs-itself-to-make-all-the-right-decisions

really do the image label from minh thingy, to prove out everything I've picked up

also wait, inference energy cost on GPT-3 seems to be quite low (4kWh/100 pages of output). Still 2-3 orders of magnitude away from human brains, but it's actually low enough to be beneficial. So, the bulk energy cost is in the training, where we're essentially doing the evolution thingy again

again, think about how to structure an active learning problem to create a fast feedback system. Basic principles should be fairly simple and easy to see, although there need not be actual implementable code to extend from. And yeah, I feel like there is a fear of generating new samples on the go and so ppl are turned away by that and don't necessarily embrace the nonlinearity of the real world

other interesting notes:
- a lot of times the network is stuck because oscillation frequency is too high. What is observed is the actions' oscillations seem to coincide with the locations' oscillations, but somehow the phase is just off and leave the system oscillating forever
- can it be that the fourier thingy sort of hides a prior behind it to make it oscillate a lot. To test this out, try this with other environments

why can't I flood the body with AC2 receptors with some pieces of cell membrane attached to it, to simulate an actual cell, so that all the covid 19 viruses sort of binds there and therefore can't bind to the AC2s in actual cells?

there also has got to be more aluminum predefined structures that's easy to use like v slots right? So look for those

for the high power thingy, see over 24V power supplies pcb designs, to get a sense of what things are on there

also, what's the curing process involving an autoclave looks like for carbon fiber?

and finally, analyze tesla's costs to make sense of everything

also, the way I sort of work is to build a small scale model, make sure it works, then do the large scale one. Only after then do I really commit large amounts of money, time and effort into something, and start worrying about selling those to customers.

goals for this trip?
- take over truckbux operations
- grow stocks
- have some skills in building simple products, like just laser cutting stuff, or metal injection molding parts, starship-related
- machine parts for complicated machine. Goal should be to machine dies or complicated parts for precision instruments
- get a good feeling of how things work in AI, especially how to debug stuff, and really analyze stuff from the inside. Pretty much what I'm doing right now, but just do it over and over again
- actually do some genetics, and see if there's actually a real chance to do this or not
- demonstrate plasmid cloning. Heard it's super simple and whatnot
- demonstrate PCR, to get in touch with the querying tools
- understand the compliment system designs, and see if I can come up with comparable systems
- create a system that accurately maps out distances of a camera feed when also given the coordinate system
- do a bunch of comparative genomics. Basically figure out the story of every life on earth. Also try to run AlphaFold2. Also try to figure out the energy landscape in all of this. Targets:
	- DNA polymerase
	- cap binding complexes
	- ribosome subunits
	- pseudouridine synthase: Z71568, YNL292w, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi?seqinput=18158779
	- mitochondria, atp synthase: NC_012920, 251831106
	- methane monooxygenase: CH4 + O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ -> CH3OH + NAD(P)+ + H2O, single bond replacements
	- amylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, fibrin, collagen, actin, insulin, potassium channels, luciferase, hemagglutinin, HIV-1 protease, p53 tumor suppressor, cellulases
- try to infect cells with modified virus with a specific payload
- create a small server farm at home in vn that I can easily access via the internet to run my heavy workloads
- actually try to run alphafold: https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/alphafold_casp13
- intercept seek thermal communications
- try to build robot arms that can do things quickly, and have a good internal model of reality
- another posibility for sequencing techniques is to have a sort of ribosome that enlarges the base pairs, so we can see them exactly with a regular microscope
- apparently, psilocybe cubensis exists in vn, so go look for them in actual forests, or 
- consider buying a 3d printer
- figure out all reactions in seablock
- buy glasses

why is aluminum more expensive than steel? Like, aluminum melts at a much lower temperature right?

also why 3.3V, 5V, 9V and 12V? Elon sort of mentioned 48V, so how exactly can you design electronics for. So apparently, heat dissipation increases with the square of voltage, so you'd want as low voltage as possible

question: can everything be built using proteins alone? Like, can stuff like cell membrane (lipid bilayer) be produced just by using proteins? If they can, then what's the exact mechanism

comprehensive source: https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/

again, what's up with bacteriophages???

also, the recording stuff is really, really crude. Like, simple pink colors for acid/bases??? That's it? That's like 1 bit of information dude. So how about, bind rare atoms to specific complexes, and have those attaches to any structure you want. Then we can excite those rare atoms, and record their EM spectrum, for a lot of data bits. Also apparently florescent systems don't have rare atoms, so figure out how the hell can they do that??? Edit: specific proteins to find: luciferase

also, what's up with the polyprotein nature of covid? Actually you know what, I heard many proteins are like that too, like histones, or hemoglobin, or atp synthase, so figure out the general dynamics of these systems

also apparently, some staining methods like gram pos/neg ppl have no idea how they work. And methods to visualize brains too, with silver atoms or sth like that

so far, this seems really, really hard. But giving up is for pussies, so play foldit for a long time to roughly understand how stuff works in this domain

also apparently there's this thing called catalytic reforming, that can shape small hydrocarbon chains into aromatic hydrocarbons, like benzene

also why the hell are there so many polymers? like pvc, polystyrene, and whatnot. See advantages and disadvantages of each of them, and see if I can replicate a small sample: PMMA, PS, PE and PP, PETE, ABS, Nylon, PMMA (acrylic), PC (polycarbonate)

what's up with otter, the company?

go over 23andme analysis

iron or nickel cathode
cobalt stabilizes nickel
carbon lattice with silica as anode

may be the only reason ppl can't automate stuff like plaque assays is because they sort of require lots of different instruments that are bulky and expensive. But why are they so freaking expensive? Like, what's the actual cost of assembling 1 for myself that meets international standards???

crystal violet seems to be a really popular staining method. It's also used in gram's method and whatnot

create my own vpn lol, that can be cheaper and quicker

do cifar 10 again, to get any insights possible, then my custom labels

also try again the style transfer, to see how my architecture can deal with such a dynamic environment

try a normal batch size, like 128, to see how long do we actually have to wait

also benchmark everything inside k1lib, to get a feeling of how all the scales work with each other, and to verify jeremy's statement that custom RNN architectures are terrible. Also to understand where to optimize stuff too, and to use this info with deep computer architecture stuff to understand the whole thing

also for ksp, develop a program for a missile to hit a plane. Should be ground to air
