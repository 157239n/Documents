so when's the tax season? April 15th

list of things to get taxes done:
- W-2s, given by employer
- Any 1099s (self-employed income, like youtube)
	- 1099-MISC: self-employed
	- 1099-INT: income from checking or savings account, bank should send this form
	- 1099-DIV: stocks or a mutual fund that pay out dividends. So I assume TD will mail me these?
	- 1099-G: state income tax returns and unemployment benefits
- Any 1098s and others (education, etc)
	- 1098-E: if paid >$600 in interest in mail, and will get back rebates
	- 1098-T: if enrolled in higher education in last year, might be eligible for an education credit or deduction
- 1095s: healthcare, if signed up for Affordable Care Act
	- 1095-A: if enrolled in the marketplace
	- 1095-B/1095-C: if ensurance comes from employer
- # from checking or savings account (for returns)
- debit or credit card (for sending the actual money), "if you are using an online tax service that costs money". So I don't need to do that if I'm doing paper forms?

main tax forms:
- 1040EZ: easy
- 1040A: short form
- 1040: long form

famous online tax preparation services, can cost money if things are more complicated than just the 1040EZ form, prepare state and federal taxes at the same time:
- H&R Block
- Turbotax
- IRS free(-ish) file: https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free

W-4 is filled out when one starts working

exemptions: things that lessen your tax burden, mostly apply to personal independency status

so, employer will withhold money from info available in W-4 automatically

"if you itemize your deductions you should prepare this information on what is called a schedule A"
