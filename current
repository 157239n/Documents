so, priorities now:
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law (aka international business law). It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

prepare ideas for that lib guy

check over my health insurance

see how coupons work in heirloom

"stores and rewards cards", and "rewards credit card", 1-5% back in cash/points. Dig more into this. Is this just a normal credit card, or is it a specific card for a specific store: https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/are-credit-card-rewards-worth-it

read Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, just to take in the concrete ideas of UBI? Reviews said that the latter half is good

yeah let's go on sunday 10pm, for that thing, because on friday there's minh and on sat there's the competition. Also bring food for her

7. joints, fastenings and people - also about creep and chariot wheels
8. soft materials and living structures - or how to design a worm
9. walls, arches and dams - or cloud towers and the stability of masonry
10. something about bridges - or saint... and saint...
11. advantage of being a beam - with observations on roofs, trusses, and masts
12. mystery of shear and torsion - or polaris and the bias-cut nightie
13. the various ways of failing in compression - or sandwiches, skulls, and dr euler
14. philosophy of design - or the shape, the weight and the cost
15. chapter of accidents - a study in sin, error, and metal fatigue
16. efficiency and aesthetic - or the world we have to live in

go over ML models and see if I can have some information extraction process out of stocks and whatnot. That link by ynes again seems nice and all that. And really get into the data and make this a dependable skillset

keep ties with that german guy

and yea, that political index idea from a year back

may be finish the docs and send over to bhacker one last time

what's lobbying?

also train myself to sleep 6 hours a day consistently, because 6 hours seems reasonable enough to keep myself productive, and the consistent part is also really important, because only then can I truely utilize the extra hours doing something useful. And also please keep pushing my absolute hardest to crunch through these goals, and may be write these logs really, really frequently

rewatch joe rogan with elon? because joe said that he felt elon didn't open up until they were drinking. So sort of analyze this?

may be I really have to go out and ask for help so I can penetrate these venues even further

how about creating a bunch of images with text inside them, and then draw a boundary layer as the correct answer? Yep this approach is quite interesting, but I have to have the data first to be able to do this

and the tone of them speaking about these things, it's almost as if they have sort of a capability to learn things distributedly, and not relying on a single data center. I also suspect this has to do with transfer learning

and may be do read into the quarterly reports

and may be really apply these ML ideas to the scientific backbone, and actually change how science works

get money in and buy a 2nd tesla stock

and pay canaris bills

pytorch, calculating gradient means loss.backward(). But I thought loss is just a number? Okay, so how they did stuff was to declare a as nn.Parameter(a). So this looks like an array wrapper and thus by using this, they can sort of know how to calculate the gradient and whatnot. I sort of couldn't imagined this flexibility a while back, and I still don't know how they did it. So may be this is worthwhile afterall

also if I can just find out where are the damn images, then I probably can develop whole system of commands to clear out unnecessary images or low quality ones, instead of cooperating with the notebook's mechanism

https://forums.fast.ai/t/find-path-to-file-imagedatabunch/50279/6

and the idea to pull live satellite data and look for smoke clouds and whatnot. And may be icebergs too? Just to give out an automatic alert whenever something abnormal is found. I think this would be valuable in terms of creating a learning workflow, and inch me closer to that idea of replacing science's core structure with something like this

"planet amazon dataset"

and may be now make models to predict some physical phenomenon? Like 3 body problem, or other stuff, like pistons and whatnot. Then make these learn on quantum data, which I think will be the nail in the coffin for traditional science

"satellite tiles"

and yeah, can I get data directly from an SSO satellite? Do people publish these data?

"multi-label classification, segmentation"

and may be look again at speec details when using these technologies

"a partial"
acc_02 = partial(accuracy_thresh, thresh=0.2)
learner.fit_one_cycle(5, slice(0.01))

wait what? So you are saying that you can just use a model trained on 128x128 images and slap it to a 256x256 image? Don't models need to stay rigid and the same size throughout?

doc_src/data_block

so after going through the sgd thingy they introduced, they kinda still ambiguous about how these architectures work, and how can I adapt this to predict scientific phenomena

image segmentation?

np.loadtxt(path_to_file.txt, dtype=str)

decrease regularization

weight decay
dropout
data augmentation

for segmentation, we can use a cnn, but something else called unet is better

so a cnn will condense things down, then the unet thing expands things out

Learner.create_unet(), so I suspect there will be a Learner.create_cnn() version too? So try this out
learner.recorder.plot_losses()
learner.recorder.plot_lr()

so I suspect that the convolution nn works with sort of an absolute max image size, and every image size below can be applied to here, so that's why you can increase the resolution to double the original (the transfer learning thingy) and it still works. Just my prediction, of course

when we do NLP classification, we actually create 2 models: language model

text_classification_learner()

and it seems like I can actually apply for a grant from drexel to begin doing these things. I can feel these goals are being checked off and can actually be executed. Oh yeah baby, I feel it so strongly it burns. Muahahahaha :v Damn what am I talking about :v Kay bye :v Man, I'm in my prime time right now. I really have to try my best in this small opportunity, and progress even faster than myself in the past

adam, rmsprop

kay, so this is interesting, ludvik is offering to pay me, but let's not reply just yet

worry about rent stuff

another pass through course.fast.ai. And remember to buy a shitload of meat today (like at 7? yeah seems right). But first let's grab some food

may be create Final Simple Net (or fixing it) again, and this time really understand the indicies so that I can dynamically create any algorithm I want

figure out what can I do with maltego? How far can I sort of collect information and doing benchmarks before I get into trouble?

do that post
