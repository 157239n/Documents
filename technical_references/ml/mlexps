goals for ML systems going forward?
- document everything as deliverable posts
- recognizes general trends from hyperparam search
- 1 experiment/day seems proper. This will help me to plan for the future as well, and create pressure to make the entire pipeline fast

task: style transfer
- see if modifying images over time have different internal dynamics than normal training
task: char name classification (50% acc, 0.8 loss is possible)
- bigru approach, understand underlying C++ codebase
task: progressive deepening
- high-res gan stuff. This should verify learning dynamics at later times (think: blind cat)
random:
- grok again, because I didn't use adamw
- graph nn

also, train a really long network, then throw out middle layers, to see if everything still works as intended. How about if I do this fast. Will the middle layers then want to pass signals through as much as possible?

try to cripple network early, then train it again, to see if it actually get stuck, and then find ways to sort of keep the network functional, but can adapt to the new environment

also, try to apply attention stuff to that gravity prediction problem earlier. Have a great feeling this will work
