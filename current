can RL agents always be reasonable when framerate switches to 30fps to 60 or higher? If they are influenced by this then it seems like the error signal attenuation still applies right? So at that point, why not just create a much simpler policy-only optimization process?

also, pay very, very close attention to human's failure modes as well, as I don't think this has been developed in the community yet

again x3, I think I can implement this whole thing without the formulation of action-state values or state values. So try out that kind of simple tree search. Also I think by creating all of the infrastructure on my own, I can really provide a new perspective in the game

env: https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py
more complex running code: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html

look up q learning on youtube or something

also see how humans actually do RL too. How can they correlate long distance reward signals? Are they even good at such a task? It seems like I can somehow use attention as this mechanism that spans multiple time frames, so as to make the RL capabilities more pronounced, as that acts kinda like a skip connection

so the model-based RL agents seems interesting, because it can do fundamental experiments in the world to build an accurate model, then use that model as a proxy for the real world, then do experiments on them, instead of on the real world

do the predicting distances by being consistent thingy, because it's a real possibility that may reveal more what's really going on

other interesting notes:
- a lot of times the network is stuck because oscillation frequency is too high. What is observed is the actions' oscillations seem to coincide with the locations' oscillations, but somehow the phase is just off and leave the system oscillating forever
- can it be that the fourier thingy sort of hides a prior behind it to make it oscillate a lot. To test this out, try this with other environments

also, try to apply attention stuff to that gravity prediction problem earlier. Have a great feeling this will work

also, several ideas for representing chemical structures:
- smiles (are you kidding me?)
- plain 2d image, and use convs
- morgan fingerprints, best used with random forests or sth like that
- my idea, kinda like an extended version of gravity attention thingy, but with fixed length features coming from variable length tokens through multiple layers
- this is actually golden. Just simple chemical domain classification (kidney/tooth/CNS/...), but does demonstrate good ability to represent chemicals: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00236#

how do ppl manufacture long dna strands again? More than what standard oligo techniques can provide

mlexps create a nice home page and status bar. Also greps for "General lessons", to create a quick index of things I learned so I can utilize it quick

goals for ML systems going forward?
- document everything as deliverable posts
- recognizes general trends from hyperparam search
- 1 experiment/day seems proper. This will help me to plan for the future as well, and create pressure to make the entire pipeline fast

task: image-classification/
- cifar10:
	- persistent depth, squeeze in width of single layers from 30 and see results
	- batch norm, conv, activation order
- same thing with random dataset from imagenet, but higher resolution, and far/near (dog vs squid, and species of dog) examples
task: style transfer
- see if modifying images over time have different internal dynamics than normal training
task: char name classification
- attention approach (already did that), same old scale experimentation
- bigru approach, understand underlying C++ codebase
task: progressive deepening
- high-res gan stuff. This should verify learning dynamics at later times (think: blind cat)
