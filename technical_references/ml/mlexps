goals for ML systems going forward?
- document everything as deliverable posts
- recognizes general trends from hyperparam search
- 1 experiment/day seems proper. This will help me to plan for the future as well, and create pressure to make the entire pipeline fast

task: char name classification (50% acc, 0.8 loss is possible)
- bigru approach, understand underlying C++ codebase
task: progressive deepening
- high-res gan stuff. This should verify learning dynamics at later times (think: blind cat)

also, try to apply attention stuff to that gravity prediction problem earlier. Have a great feeling this will work

----------- for later

- migrate blackbox posts to mlexps
- try to do conv5 in blackbox series, so that all linear operations are effectively merged together

rerun char-rnn/5-attn-sizing, so that the graph looks better
rerun imagenet/5-blind-cat, but this time make the image smaller, then bigger, instead of using gaussian blur. Scale factor can be 8x or even 16x

figure out choke limits to vae again, this time for multiple datasets, just to see trends

investigate adversarial attacks again
