# Ruby on Rails commands

## Get up and going

- Installing rails: `gem install rails -v <version number>`, like `gem install rails -v 5.0.0`
- Making a new app: `rails _<optional version number>_ new <app name>`, like `rails new someApp` or `rails _5.0.0_ new someApp`
- Installing all the necessary dependancies: `bundle install`
- Running locally: `rails server`

## Heroku

- Logging in: `heroku login`
- Creating a remote: `heroku create`. At this point it will show you the remote git address and you have to connect to heroku manually
