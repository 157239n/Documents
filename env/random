Reality check on renewables ted talk (David MacKay, "Sustainable energy - without the hot air", chief science advisor to UK Dept. of Energy and Climate Change):

UK energy consumption: 125kWh per day per person (when I actually do the calculations, doesn't seem like so. Really check the validity of this):
- 40 for transport
- 40 for heating
- 40 for electricity
- others

Top of the line countries: 2.5W/m^2 (each day). This level is what we should aim for to provide to the world
Wind power: 2.5W/m^2
Solar PV: 5-20W/m^2 (given in the talk, 230W/m^2 calculated myself (probably for insolation), online resources indicates 45W/m^2 (for panels, when exposed to 230W/m^2 at 20% efficiency))
Concentrating solar power: 15-20W/m^2
Nuclear: 1000W/m^2
Sunlight: 342W/m^2 (kinda controversial overhere)

Andasol Solar Power Station: Europe's first parabolic trough power plant:
- Solar radiance/insolation: 250W/m^2 (quoted as "exceptionally high"), but totaling around 97W/m^2 only, so 38% efficiency
Other plants (check out https://www.youtube.com/user/beyondzeroemissions/videos btw)? Btw the promotional vid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsLnIYKo-qk) of that plant looks so cool you know. What's the profession there called?

Transport:
- Normal car: 80kWh per 100km
- Electric car (go check with Tesla on this one): 15kWh per 100km
- Train: 3-6kWh per 100km
- Motorcycle (go check with numbers from a large pool of Vietnamese motorcycles): 3kWh per 100km
- Bicycle: 1kWh per 100km

For battery, losees 20-40% when put electricity in and out (so 10-20% when put in and take out individually)

Denmark and Germany has maxed out area for wind and solar

Concentrations:
- CO2: 405 ppm (2017)
- CO2e: 490 ppm
- Highest before: around 295 ppm at 125k years ago

Planning to operation delays:
- Of nuclear: 120 gCO2e/kWh
- Wind, CSP: 10 gCO2e/kWh
- Solar PV: 45 gCO2e/kWh

Electricity rates: gem: https://www.iea.org/statistics/prices/, also here: https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/electricity_prices/
- Solomon islands: 99 cent/kWh, highest in the world
- Jamaica: 44 cent/kWh
- California: 16.2 cent/kWh
- Germany: 29.4 cent/kWh. Some 35 cent/kWh. Stats: https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts. Highest in the world that is 
"normal". There are other places that are higher than Germany but a lot of studies cite them as the normal highest
- France: 16 cent/kWh
- Solar, some claimed 1.79 cent/kWh
- US: 12 cent/kWh
- China: 7 cent/kWh
- Russia: 5.5 cent/kWh
- Vietnam: 5 cent/kWh
- Saudi Arabia: 2 cent/kWh

Oil prices:
- Crude oil: $0.45/L
- Automotive diesel: $1/L
- Gasoline: $1/L

"Electricity from solar roof tops costing 2 times more than electricity from farms"
house cats kill billions of birds every year, while hundred thousand from wind turbines

Lignite, kinda like coal

Last time CO2 ppm was this high is 125k years ago, at around 300ppm, 1-2 degrees higher than normal

612k
439k
413k
373k
832k

India pledged before Paris to build 30 nuclear plants, while they are planning to build 5 only

Gasses outlawed by Kyoto protocol:
- CO2
- CH4
- Nitrous Oxide
- Hydrofluorocarbons. Oh, the thing in refrigeration mentioned in project Drawdown. 5000-10000 times more powerful than CO2
- Perfluorocarbons
- Sulfur Hexafluoride

Diplomatic immunity: codified in 1961 in Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
- functional immunity
- full immunity

effects of CO2: 500k atomic bombs a day, or 5/sec
