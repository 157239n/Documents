So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- (done) Learn about the remaining IT stuff: Docker and Gradle
- (low priority) Learn about networking and possibly wiggle around the Raspberry Py to understand more
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN

So what's the carrying capacity for the human race?

Now it kinda feels the whole field is a bit toxic, because like, it appears that we have exceeded our carrying capacity and further advocacy might as well tank the world's economy

green new deal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxIDJWCbk6I

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Also understand the perspective of a climate scientists doing these things too. Examples would be Hayhoe (obvious), Laura Iraci, Rama Nemani, Matthew Hansen
Thomas Friedman
Susan Rice, us national security advisor

Also see the process of how oil refineries work, how pumpjacks work to the point as if I'm visiting it. Do the same for those industries that I care so much about, like ethanol, steel and cement. Do the same for a solar plant like Andasol.

I guess I wanted to learn about automation is to know if I can build my own factory/plant. If I can, and if I know how professional stuff are done there, I can out source it effectively, and at the same time manage the money flow too.

Also see how can solar panels are mass produced, what are the remaining challenges, (or any). Also see whether it will solve the electricity problem in full (meaning I can clearly see a path, and measure progress on that path) as I thought it would. If not then I'll have to reevaluate my plan

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year

How about the science left to do with Lithium and Lithium ion batteries?

And again, look into creating several startup types, one being manufacturing, one being industrial, one being web service, one being biochemical engineering.

Familiarize myself with permits and environmental regulations that are floating around in the world right now.

To understand the supply chain and how can I affect it, look for ways to mitigate palm oil.

"climate change without bullshit". Important article to go through: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/climate-change-global-warming-scenarios-ambition

Dig into the quick history of human kind. Possibly watching Origins again

Kickstarter: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7lzqyo/anyone_have_experience_with_kickstarter_tips/

Also intro to family planning and those kind of stuff.

In light of drawdown, how about I discuss it with a lot of people, hold conferences at many different places and also change the textbook?

get into the mining and petrochemical industry. Also play satisfactory to begin to appreciate the size of these industrial machines, also the interconnections between them. https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/satisfactory/home. Did so, but it seems like this view of full automation is kind of misleading, because in the real world, we do not have the freedom of picking up factories and ploping them down. We have a preconceived idea of how the factory is structured, how things move in and out, and there is typically only 1 main assembling line. Other improvements are about efficiency, speed-wise. So it's really, really different from the type of scaling in satisfactory or in factorio.

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

archicad

what's the deal with hadoop

oh wow, this is such a gem about manufacturing and prototyping: https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-parts-injection-molding

okay, so I got the heavy industries down. I know what machines are there, how do these pieces fit together. Now see the same for the semiconductor industry, and what's the deal with all of those substrates, the doping and the etching? Also how metal working works, and how foundaries work too. For this, may be look for yt channels like king of random or night hawk

some recycling stats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxaN_xqQh4

so I guess what I wanted to do about climate through all of these investigation might be giving out suggestions to improve stuff

Manufacturing:
- "reddit industrial machine design process"
- I still don't know how to build a factory from scratch tho, so still make an effort to dig into it
- also should I get involved in the manufacturing business?
- also what software do they use for monitoring automated stuff? Probably a course in automation will do it
- profile sinarmas
- also how oil products are refined
- how electricity in industrial systems work?

also see over how public talking works, what venues I can penetrate into

how waste management works
also how to futureproof myself
how to contract out for a whole factory?
so the guts of mechanical engineering is to be damn precise and to be rigid

go over android again, also how bluetooth works on that gig a year ago

about the climate stuff. What resources do I have an infinite amount of that I can rely on? I have been taking electricity for granted

may be getting back into the finite element analysis thing if I have time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txk-VO1hzBY

also read on structures of revolutions
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

read the 14 pages of the green new deal
also metals scarcity seems to be a thing too. So dig into that
the art of not being governed: an anarchist history of upland southeast asia, james scott

Global climate action summit (9 hours long summit lol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxHDD_pLf0
also go through all of practical engineering to get the feel for the field
so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also, may be go over really quickly the economic vids on khan academy, they have a lot of content and possibly gems that I can utilize

and then finish the freakonomics book. Why do I feel like that book is kinda more anecdotal and won't actually introduce to the big picture.

what's the deal with chemtrails?

how water works, mesopotamia, 691 BCE

how about something like factorio, but much deeper, requiring much more effort, containing a lot more content. But this time it will be simpler. I'm imagining something like an industry simulator

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

International Sea Level Institute.
Sanan Sino-Science, chinese comp that plant trees in doors, price 11 times higher than the market average. No pescitides needed, and not much water needed too

Also dig into hydroponics and aquaponics

again, I feel that econ stuff is so "floating". I don't know where their absolute zero is. But I suspect that no one actually know how it works and just follow with the flow. Also, spend some time writing about how problems in Factorio differ from logistic problems in real life

Again, try to make an ASIC, application specific integrated circuits. Try to get myself to the cutting edge of these circuits and systems.

write a post explaining the complexities of gradle together with CI/CD and docker, and compare that to the financial infrastructure of today. Also related is how all of these abstractions are just to deal with the shear scale of things we have built our civilization with. But really, the roots of everything is really, really simple. Also mention the mind-blowing abstractions of things like first-order functions.

- reality check on renewables

go through this, and consider this done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE

ethical hacking, 15 hours: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE

also I feel like I need to study physics rigorously now, with the state of mind that I've got

https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html

so, applications:
- that ocr thing with nutritional value (lmao, and make it quick). Also for money stuff
- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- try out google genomics
- see how the folks who aggregate together a bunch of forest data did it
- see how the folks who aggregate together a bunch of earthquake data did it
- then the story of energy

plow through android once more, to get the philosophy and the way of doing things

also what's the deal with peer to peer networks

- read more about how these molecules are formed, then simulate that

talks on rendering:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdN06E6Xn9E
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ2KTRn4BMI

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

with the forces in check, see if I can simulate beams being stressed

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

methane stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62VXwjT-csQ

and try out what happens with lidar stuff? How to integrate them?

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also I still don't get the interface for climate change. I mean, the common technical language ppl talk with each other in the field, so dig into that.

wtf is this https://americas.ramboll.com/projects

how about that world science festival thing brian greene hosted

see the interface between python and other data packages, how the interfaces work

the simulations, implement locality with hashmap stuff

I still don't understand the advantages of nginx over something like apache. It seems like to me that nginx people gets excited about fastcgi, and that nginx serves static pages really, really fast. But like, with all of the complexities introduced by things like oauth2, and cms, is it even worth it? Like, yes, you serve static pages faster, but who serves static pages nowadays anyways? https://www.plesk.com/blog/various/nginx-vs-apache-which-is-the-best-web-server/

Then read over those 2000 pages magento, then understand the existing apis for the big picture.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

simulate boyles law for chi, and the sterling engine where air is forced on the side. Also think about how would you do forces on a beam. Do this, or a collab with her is impossible.

stocks again, check out docs for robinhood

seems nice, go over wp over here: https://www.youtube.com/user/MattGeri/playlists. Again, the point of all this is to be able to port over kuche. Once I've done that then no need to go over wp. But may be watch the original series once more, to get the intuition behind that.

buy chi and dan some stuff from spacex store

and, learn nodejs in a few hours so I can sort of show dan what's that about. Seems like dan's not really following my path, and she kinda just want things serendipitously, and that's okay too. And by doing this, hopefully I can be comfortable in adapting to new tech really fast and deploy these things even faster. But again, goddammit, I still need to understand the firmware interface.

may be I should do the planning when there's no internet and currently being quarantined and watched and stuff. Then when I got back, the documents are already very clear and the implementation can be really, really quick.

so, i've just set myself a really, really ambitious deadline to finish the virus back up strategy because I told chi that the virus has that capability and I have to show her this capability on wednesday lmao

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSWU4L/Transact/imc_Transact/imc_Transact.html

for kuche, immediately port over the entire website over to the singapore server, and this time make it through a proxy of some sorts, so that I can do zero downtime updates (near to zero only, not entirely zero)

So they say that to make zero downtime possible, just put it behind a load balancer, the traditional one. This kinda means that I have to understand about networking and stuff, which I'm kinda actively avoiding, but look over TCP/IP illustrated

update the user with a new curl using -L to bypass https

save the path I laid out for that yt guy for chi, and reply to that person too

okay, so port the virus quickly, then separate that, then put separate applications under separate docker-compose projects, so that I can precisely control how everything will run

redo git

after I have understood networking, return to that stack overflow question of mine and answer that question

also rewatch zero days, or read that quora post again, to get the details of stuxnet to tell chi

startup folder on linux?

and to handle all the sql stuff, there are several paths:
- do the initial setup inside the Dockerfile, then reimport all of the sql data too, which is undesireable, because that would take a long time if the site were to grow. This is pretty much rock solid and no data corruption will ever occur, unless you do some really stupid things.
- do the initial setup after the container has been created, and /var/lib/mysql has been mounted, then do the initial setup there. The next time mysql is started up, all the data is still on the mounted disk. This has the chance of corrupting the data, and each time some potentially breaking update happens, we can't use this any more, and have to manually set up the database again.

So how about try using the mysql container? Like, no ports has to be exposed to the public network, because there will be private networks for me to use anyway, so no encapsulation properties are lost.

How the hell can nginx can do things differently from apache? It has to forked of a process to handle the incoming tcp request right? So it's the same thing afterall. Is it good at caching stuff? But apache has that capability too

see over the security claims digitalocean made, and see whether I can keep using their services for my testing ground

using redis? Cause like, everyone seems to be using it

macvlan driver:
- subnet info
- gateway
- range of ip address that can be assigned
- which interface or sub-interface to use? I thought this can be deducted from the subnet info?

docker network create -d macvlan \
	--subnet=10.0.0.0/24 \
	--ip-range=10.0.0.0/25 \
	--gateway=10.0.0.1 \
	-o parent=eth0.100 \
	macvlan100

so, ipv6 guide for ipv4 people

okay that's new, load balancer in digitalocean does not support ipv6

read over digitalocean's terms of service, to get the feel for legal stuff: https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/

swarm again:

ports:
- 

so, nginx cutting edge stuff, sounds interesting:
- http/2
- media streaming
- cloud and container environment
traditional operational topics:
- monitoring
- debugging
- performance
- operational tips

tasks for tonight:
- kuche stuff, entirely
- tcp/ip illustrated stuff
- docker networking, docker swarm and docker deep dive stuff, entirely
- compartmentalize virus and those shared services
- try moving 157239n over to deployment server 2 and smash a content delivery network onto it

kay, so try using nginx to load balance stuff

For the 157239n and the kuche, I must have access to the internal dns server to experiment, and I can't do any of that shit now on this computer.

okay, so think about nginx as a front facing load balancer, and only think of it like that. Serving static content does not fucking matter once you integrate a cdn. But again, think about certs too and how that comes into play in nginx

so, books to process:
- tcp/ip illustrated
- docker

okay, so porting over the old website seems pretty possible now. Let's test port it, after backing up the virus data

also how can I check for load issues on apache, to figure out how I can make it faster, without just dumping more ram into it?
