25TW for world currently, 7TW for electricity only, 3.7TW for electricity if all vehicles are electric. So, say 12TW goal for the future. That over a day is 300TWh. Need 200 gigafactories for 20 years to cover energy used in the future for electricity generation and transport

23GWh, tesla battery production rate for 2018
50GWh/yr projected 2018
final: 150GWh/yr -> 1.5 mil cars/yr
