MemoryProfiler, run for multiple batches, to see the ups and down, and to detect memory leaks.

document graphEqn, and show examples where it's useful

rename to gE again, and have something like gE(a = gE.Var()), so that variable names can be captured. Also do the multiple expression thingy, may be .also(). The vision is to just multiply stuff at will, then check a visualization graph to see how many source variables are left. Then we can manually set those, and every value will just pop into life!

upload graphEqn lol

https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/event_handling.html

a module that's pretty advanced built upon graphEqn, so that I can explore chem processes easily

Use ByteTensor as dna, rna and protein sequences
Dna and rna, each 30 cats, proteins 70 cats

Create a test file that tests scope claims, meaning "cli" alone can be reached from the global namespace

build a JIT compiler that can merge multiple clis together seemlessly in the background. This is such a massive undertaking that I don't want to do it right now:
- merges multiple mtmS back to back

split stream functionality, but both are feeding from the same internal list

blocks(), to get streams of indented blocks
