"treaty of pahee"

Also how does the connection between countries work? How can one company be international? That's under the private international law, not the public I'm investigating, but still interesting, so dig into that

Again, how can contracts be reinforced? Okay, so sort of under a single jurisdiction (aka inside a country), the bully to enforce is law enforcement officers, and the ppl to report to is lawyers and courts. At the international stage, the bully is each other, and the ppl to report to is someone high level enough to cause a UN meeting. Then the country will send a diplomat with the country's ideals and fight for it. This seems clear enough, but dig deeper in several jurisdictions, to get the feel for it

Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961

"legal fiction"

limited liable company = corporation. What are the other options?

how converting treaties to customary international laws work?

"Berne Convention", or "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works", seems to be the trans-national copyright agreement agreed by every state. This is quite interesting, so dig more into that
