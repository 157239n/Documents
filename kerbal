create air to ground missiles and orbit to ground missiles (aka Rods From The Gods) in ksp. Some claim that the rods from gods have limited target window, so a lot of them is needed to be truely effective

also how does programming a vehicle in ksp works? Is it really that hard? I want to kinda auto-launch a satellite to geostationary orbit, then measure temperature and shits there. But first try that out manually
