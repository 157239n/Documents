Precise and laser focus goals right now:
- Understand exactly how the literature sees the problem at hand, and what is the big picture they are suggesting
- Figure out how some of the key players in CCUS technology do their thing, like their business model, their calculations, their net impact on the world, and on the interactions with Big Oil
- Figure out how can I help them to scale quickly their production targets, and see if I can push it for an exponential growth. This is extremely important, and lies at the fundamental of my plan. If I cannot do this then I don't think anyone will, and well, the world will be fucked up when facing with the emission targets for 2030 and 2050. And if I cannot do this then my plan essentially goes broke, so it's crucial to correct my self of this plan early in the game, so my backup plan is still valid.


Not so laser focus goals, but important ones to achieving:
- (Seemingly done after playing factorio) Understand how industrial systems work, how chemicals are treated
- Understand some of the tool chemists use in labs, and what are the equivalents, fast and dirty way to handle them in a plant
- Figure out the balance of power between nations, what nations are key to all of this, what nation really has the potential to change and how someone like me can perform that goal, given time and effort.
- Figure out the balance of industries and what industry should I jump into.
- Figure out how can I incentivize an incentive scheme inside of companies, may be setting the right attitude for each employee. Not the kind of alarmist though, but rather give them a path to profit, and out source products that do just that from OEMs or respectable manufacturers.
- Write a post cutting through all of the bullshit and getting to the problem at hand, quickly and effectively.
- Also make friends with some researchers to ask them about their opinion (once I got the gist of everything that's happening), and to include them in said posts and may be publish it to a respective newspaper.
- See how I can have multiple passive income sources




I hate heartfelt wishes
Also write a post explaining possible attack points, about what are the important things. Also what are the important bodies, what are they doing, what's the general status of the world, and how to mitigate them. Also what things are really adding up and what does not. Personally I think that this kind of stuff can't really be advised, just because I couldn't see where that gives me that kind of thing.
