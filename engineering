steel making:
- dust from zinc and other metals, considered abrasive, hazardous waste

Terminology and concepts:
- steady-state, inputs, outputs, no state changes. Of course, there are many, many definitions of something not changing
- conversion: how much of the initial input was used. Less than 100% means waste
- yield: how much final product you can get from your initial input. Yield = 30% means conversion = 30% conversion. So I think the main difference between them is that conversion is used to describe inputs, while yield to describe outputs. Also conversion and yield only cover start and end of an operation
- accumulation: when things don't go steady-state. input - output = accumulation. More complex: input - output + generation (internal) - consumption (internal) = accumulation
- reversibility: can get back to initial state with no work input, impossible in real life. Goal is to make it so that it can be reversed a whole lot
- efficiency: 0 to 1, ratio of what you get out compared to what you put in, how close a system is to being fully reversible

product lifecycle: materials ----reactor && separator (separates waste from product)----> contaminated waste ---purge system---> waste --> materials

Rules of thermodynamics:
- 0th: Equilibrium means same
- 1st: D_U + D_KE + D_PE = Q - W, about quantity of energy
  - D_U: Delta internal energy
  - D_KE: Delta kinetic energy
  - D_PE: Delta potential energy
  - Q: heat added to the system (system gains energy)
  - W: work done by the system (system loses energy)
    - WS: shaft work, any mechanical energy other than what's necessary for flow
  - Scenerios:
    - Stationary system: D_KE = 0, D_PE = 0, system that doesn't move
    - Adiabatic process: No heat transfer, or Q = 0
    - Isochoric process: Volume of system is constant, meaning W = 0
- 2nd: Quality of energy, a heat engine will never be 100% efficient, cuz entropy needs to increase
  - Carnot engine, I don't really understand, but states that maximum efficiency is 1 - T_L / T_H

Energies:
- Internal (can't cross object boundaries):
  - Kinetic:
    - Translational
    - Rotational
  - Potential
    - Gravitational
    - Elastic
  - Internal: energy associated with seemingly random movement of molecules
- Can move between stuff:
  - Heat
  - Work

Heat engine: machine converts heat to any other forms of energy
Efficiency, Work/Heat added to system, >=0, <1

Cycles, initial and final states are the same

HFC, usually referred to as freon

Fluid mechanics: studies how fluids respond to the forces exerted on them
Car interacts with air, "transfer" happens:
- Transfer of momentum
- Transfer of heat
- Transfer of mass

Stress
Strain
Viscosity

"so slip condition", meaning the fluid layer right at the boundary moves with the boundary. If the boundary is stationary then it won't move
stress = force / cross sectional area
- Normal stress: F acts positive x, object lengthens positive x
- Shear stress: F acts positive x, object lengthens on top, stay the same on bottom
strain = deformation that stress causes on a system
- Normal strain: change in length / initial length
- Shear strain: delta angle
Viscosity, fluid's resistance to flow
Newtonian fluid: viscosity is independent of stress

Reynolds: Predict when a flow goes from laminar to turbulent, make Reynolds number = D of pipe * V of fluid * fluid density / fluid viscosity
- Laminar
- Turbulent
- Transitional, mix between the 2. Turbulence near middle of pipe, laminar near edge of pipe
Also found out about forces:
- Inertial: driving force, push force, main thing causes turbulence
- Viscous: represent resistance to flow
Number: inertial/viscous
- Low -> laminar (< 2100)
- High -> turbulent (> 4000)

Bernoulli's principle: Speed of fluid increase -> pressure drop will decrease, vice versa. Restatement of kinetic and potential. Only applies to isentropic flow (doesn't involve heat transfer).
- Points in a pipe: Pressure + 0.5 * density * v^2 + density * g * h = const (equal to every other point in a pipe)

Types of heat transfers:
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

Thermal resistance: R = Layer thickness (L) / (Thermal conductivity (k) * Area (A)) = Temp difference / heat transfer rate

Heat exchanger:
- concentric tube

Momentum transfer, driving force is difference in velocity
Heat transfer, driving force is difference in temperature
