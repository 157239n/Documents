interesting quotes:
- "many legal issues occur with companies because they violate the laws of a country where they are not incorporated but perform transactions"
- "some jurisdictions will not recognize the exclusion of implied warranties"
- "the courts will usually enforce a Terms of Use agreement against either party if it's clear that both parties clearly agreed to it, and both parties knew what they were agreeing to"
- "there are certain clauses that courts will not enforce under any circumstances. For example, clauses that are designed to trick or exploit the user, or clauses that are forbidden by law"

	- amount of money you're willing to pay out in damages if such a loss occurs

obtaining acceptance:
- clickwrap: can't do anything unless press button to accept the agreement
- browsewrap: users implicitly agree to term of use simply by browsing. Much harder to enforce. To do that:
	- make sure term of use is clearly displayed
	- include "browsing website constitutes acceptance of the agreement" in a clause in terms of use document
	- take opportunity to draw users' attention to the document
