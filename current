So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN, check out docs for robinhood

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

467kWh - 1.2tr

for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

doug ellison, amature guy, eventually works in jpl, uses data from nasa, the freely accessible ones

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

- BioLite, solving particulate matter problem, seems like they did quite a good job, reducing 95%, so check them out
- position dynamics: http://www.positrondynamics.com

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed (listened all of that one btw)):
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- see how those folks aggregating data do it. At this point, I should have an idea of how this is like, with the mola plan above, so this will be sort of a best practice kind of approach. Candidate starting point would be that p5.js sketch thing, with the earthquake data, and also the website that aggregate deforestation information
- may be setting up tesseract again, then deal with all of those low hanging fruits that can be easily automated, to make my life a tad bit easier. https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-re, and post on improving input image quality: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality
- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- read understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf

how mergers work?

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

https://pitmonticone.github.io/rcp85-debate/

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

add option to not display the nodes/description for ludvik

"how economies work". I think I got it, but not entirely sure, so still, look for people's interpretation of this, and I might get a really good answer.

policy hub too, 2 documents now

figure out how elon got to stay in the US?

also see over how public talking works, what venues I can penetrate into
find that place/club where chi can practice speaking and singing

"pmi-pmbok"

"stripe has php library to accept credit cards without needing a merchant account". So like, what I want to do with all these testing is to make the money transferring process as testable and as throwaway as possible. I think that through experimenting with this, I can really get to know the rules of the game. Also some said I can just sign up for a paypal account, then include a button that will redirect users to paypal's site, then it will do the rest and I get the money. This is a bit dangerous tho. Like what if, the returning request, like the callback mechanism of oauth doesn't work? What's there to sync the data between the paypal account and my internal db? Boy, then I'd really have to make everything as highly available as possible (well, look into the ability to sort of confirm to paypal at another time so that this issue can be mitigated), or else I don't know how to handle the legal reprecussions.

Also, how does the legal side of things integrate with like, credit card companies? Like, following the principle that money can be anything a group of ppl deems valuable, and if you can make everyone trust you, then the fictional money you invented really have value. So like, venmo sort of invent this new currency, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, then it really have value. Then does the gov just let this happen? Or they jump and regulate a player when it seems to be creating an idea resembling money?

"The other thing you need to worry about is the coming of PCI compliance which basically says if you are not compliant, you (or the company you work for) will be liable by your Merchant Bank and/or Card Vendor for not being compliant by July of 2010. This will impose large fines on you and possibly revoke the ability for you to process credit cards." This is sort of perflexing, because, I thought PCI compliance worries banks and credit card networks, like Visa and MasterCard, and not individual businesses. But this quote seem to suggest that normal businesses must also be PCI compliant and thus, have sort of a pen testing personnel come in to check for vulnerabilities and if the business pass, then it's granted the PCI compliant status

ask lawyers that I know of to answer some of the questions above. Candidates would be Hieu Man, that small girl studying law (man I feel guilty for not remembering her name), mama (may be? but seems like she doesn't know about this stuff), ynes (yeah, i like her, so duh), then forums

some suggest braintree, which sounds familiar enough. Heck, there's even a prebuilt Magento module, so it must be quite big

so, what's the long term plan now?
- see how to hack the economic system, by framing everything of value in the view that value is what we create it
- see how to hack the environment, and really, really see non-bullshit ways of going about solving this, because we only have 10-15 years to reach <2 degrees, and 1-2 years to reach <1.5 degrees
- see how to hack the government. See how government works. I sort of know roughly how they work by now already, partly because the public international law thingy which it reveals that the international community is still sort of based on DNS, or decentralized systems, in a way. Feels like there's a lot of similarities between all distributed systems, and that the computing side of distributed systems are more secure while the distributed system of nations are more loosely coupled (however, still behaving right along the incentives), because they can do so, because nations move slow, and because radical shocks don't really occur in nations (and when they do, that nation sort of crumbles and disappears and everyone else is either in shit because the whole world is in shit or they just don't care about the collapsed nation). Anyway, I sort of understand how they work, but how about the chain of command and social structure needed to control things like immigration, like imports, like taxes, like border control. I'll consider I understand this when I can create a nation on my own (which tbh, seems like all I need to create a nation is respect from others (which can come if I'm powerful, both militarily and economically), an effective way to control my colony, and a lot of paperwork to follow the rules of international law), with all the functionalities ppl associated with a nation.
- see how to hack human psychology, just basically what humans want, why humans want what they want (must be explained by the gene wanting to stay immortal thingy), how to effectively give them what they want (with myself feeling good and with a sense of purpose, which should be easy), and how to effectively give them what they want without knowing I'm doing this background thing, probably how I did things with Nhi. And like, ppl might call be being fake and all, but then again, that can only occur when the representation is leaked. If the representation has no way of leaking itself, then lies and truths don't really matter anymore, because then, I will have successfully decouple human values from my values and sort of be a truely general intelligence. Like, I've done this for a while now, from how I sort of dumbing stuff down when explaining to other ppl, to events with hannie, to events with nhi, etc. And also note that if I were to really do this, once the representation is exposed, ppl will forever think I'm fake, and that's really an inconvenience, because I've essentially lost that resource to harvest and my human side sort of be sad over that. So like, train myself to disregard those and to sort of numb them and myself, if possible. Anyway, so because I've done a lot of that stuff before, I really want doing it to be systematic and to devise some rules that I can repeatedly do so that I don't have to think much about it.

oh and as a side effect of that international law thingy, I sort of understand how that Ho guy can sort of convince france and whatnot to back down on their aggression.

look into the docker root problem (about security, and root user thing) again, because this might be a huge problem that I'm neglecting

interesting article: https://serverfault.com/questions/835660/cdn-how-is-it-possible-that-my-dns-delivers-a-different-ip-depending-on-the-vis

about that thought experiment of what if venmo decides to treat 1 venmo dollar as 2 US dollar? Which parties will suffer, which parties will flourish?

try out ynes's setup, to understand the things ynes wants to do, and to see the general workflow when trying to come up with these ML models. Currently, these models still seem so much less powerful and important than other existing models, like that employee with a super rare skillset.

so, an idea to establish trust and massively gain trust from millions of ppl procedurally, where the core basis of the trust can change? This seems like something economic theories or blockchain has already solved, and it's just not popular enough (the irony, haha)

and just have a rough understanding of what can I do as an F1 student? Can I just spring up a store? Can I register for a merchant bank account? If not, can I register for venmo's merchant bank account?

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law. It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

linux hosts file, at /etc/hosts, service nscd restart

oh and, go through mail one more time. I know it's like hell, with all those security mechanisms, but this time, set up a dead simple one, using a mail client that doesn't care about security, and increase security over time. The goal is to be able to integrate all of these functionalities, distill them into images and churn out products (aka commerce sites/sites) in the matter of minutes

may be ask nhat to dig deeper into AI? Like, AI (especially reinforcement and the whole safety field) work sort of falls under the category of philosophy, which he apparently is doing a lot of. And like, using his brain power and how much time he has got, it seems plausible that he can make a difference in the AI safety field, which would be so cool to see happen. So like, read through all of the stuff he has got over his website (using a VPN, to skew the statistics and to make sure he don't figure it out), understand the current state of mind he is currently having, then intercept that thought and suggest that he can take up this task.

ideas for hackathon?
- (easy) tool to load test the shit out of a system. More generally, a tool to do benchmarking
- (hard) virus with zero day exploits or at least near-zero day exploits. Or one that can implant faked device drivers
- (crazy hard) games like eterna, or foldit, where some biology or chemistry is involved
- (easy) mola (mars orbiter laser altimeter) dataset, look for good places to land and whatnot
- (medium) satellite tracking with accelerometer to know where to point phone to, using TLE (two-line element set) datasets
- (hard) 3d scanning, so that one can move their camera around (still put the object on a white background) and it will carve out the model
- (hard) rail gun/coil gun. Extension will be multiple shaped charge with synced ignition signal, just like with Fat Man
- (easy-medium) that fan idea of chi (fluffy candy machine)
- (hard) simplified miegakure (marc's original version). Have a 2-3d game and 3-4d game, or like 4D Toys
- (crazy hard) pen testing tool which automatically looks out for vulnerabilities and exploit them just enough for me to take over
- (crazy hard) simulate a 10-qbit system so that it's playable
- (medium) simulate stress structures. This is quite straightforward, because I used to do something like this
- (medium) simulate sterling engine
- (medium) ocr thing with [nutritional value, bills]
- (crazy hard) computational fluid dynamics
- (medium-hard) visualize political structures, who's who, what do they most likely want and report back who will be the easiest to sway his/her opinion. popoloproject.com and docs.everypolitician.org/use_the_data.html
- (hard) partial information reconstruction. This is used in MRIs (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~jmb/lectures/medimanallecture1.pdf) and the event horizon telescope to act as an earth-sized telescope
- (easy) tool to analyze dimensionality of coastlines
