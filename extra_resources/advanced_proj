Well, not advanced, just out of scope for me currently, and I might not want to touch them a lot because they are distracting to my goal, but fun nonetheless

document and publish all of my current packages which is Progress and Complex only tbh. Matrix, KNet, Graph2D can be candidates, but they are not refined enough. There are also potential gems and ideas inside SeleniumTest, Lisp and StateMachines that I might continue to work on later
also pick up again on PassiveCircuitSim. Plug in the beta rule for transistors to see if it can solve it

Path from now that is shelved:
- finish Hacking - Art of Exploitation
- make an effort in shellcoder's handbook
- finish transition to Java post
- learn basics of quantum computers

Now that keras is understandable, dig into how is the compile method taken into account?

Series of blog to write:
- (i don't know enough) How the hell can computers work at all?
- (done) How the hell can programs work at all? Are they using magic? (building an Lisp interpreter)
- (too short) What's the deal with all different programming languages?
- (done) Processing to Java
- (i don't know enough) How does the web works/How to make a web, explain like I'm 5 (include things like the juliasetsbot)
- (already done modsim) Science on computers (introduce models and that kind of stuff)
- (too short/i don't know enough) What the hell is a quantum computer (explain and include examples of teleporting by using the image of large matrix multiplication)
- (too short? may be? may be not?) Why do we care about Science

Create a gravitational field bot, where objects move like normal, but initialized randomly. Then the objects will light up for a few short seconds so that we can capture the dynamics

computational fluid dynamics
try to simulate truss analysis myself, to get the feel for structural simulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qms9xt3sbQ
also simulate velocity analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzNik6PEKG8
also turbulence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G32LXeCx7H0
also failures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbv2rOEMyiA

try to implement this idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09mb78oiPkA&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi&index=10 at around 30:00

get solid on mechanical and all types of simulations again

- do the local hash map implementation for bounce dynamic, and measure performance
- then simulate a stirling engine, with hot wall side vibrating constantly and cold wall side actively dampening its motion

with the forces in check, see if I can simulate beams being stressed
simulate boyles law for chi, and the sterling engine where air is forced on the side. Also think about how would you do forces on a beam. Do this, or a collab with her is impossible.

serendipitous goals:
- make separate demo pages on every proc? Build it at processing.kelvinho.org/projects and /{project-name}
- publish vsepr and uniform electric grid (seems like I have already done this)

may be, the usb stick still have some content left. I mean, I haven't plugged it in for extended periods of time, and TRIM might not be enabled there. Yeah it has the thing with the operating system there, but just may be? Like, I don't want to lose a part of me

Again, try to make an ASIC, application specific integrated circuits. Try to get myself to the cutting edge of these circuits and systems.

read more about how these molecules are formed, then simulate that

also I feel like I need to study physics rigorously now, with the state of mind that I've got

- then do actual simulations of cfd
- get the mola mars data (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter), then fill 'em up with water, to probe at the actual scale of a planet, then try to read over casey's work to see how he does his simulation
- then see over other nasa's dataset, preferably about earth and start to dive deep into the current state of climate stuff, because I still don't entirely get it

nice read: https://nickcraver.com/blog/2017/05/22/https-on-stack-overflow/

so, an idea to establish trust and massively gain trust from millions of ppl procedurally, where the core basis of the trust can change? This seems like something economic theories or blockchain has already solved, and it's just not popular enough (the irony, haha)
