these are for really impactful ideas I collected that I believe is possible in the immediate time frame, but far enough so it remains a huge challenge for me

and greene's idea of creating simulations advanced enough that will give us powerful intuition about quantum mechanics how we understand newtonian mechanics. This is a great idea on how to actually communicate the hard core science to other people who just couldn't care less. So, keep this idea in mind for long enough so I will at least attempt to do this. But yeah, it's natural for him to think of these ideas, because he has been communicating science in a long time

so, apparently mycelium can in fact break C and H bonds in gasolene, so can it break down other stuff like plastic? I mean, this would be the perfect bioweapon against anything if you tweak things enough. Kay so this is damn interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5frPV58tY
