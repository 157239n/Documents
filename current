So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN, check out docs for robinhood

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year
467kWh - 1.2tr
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

doug ellison, amature guy, eventually works in jpl, uses data from nasa, the freely accessible ones

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

company provisioning:
- d-rev
- windpax
- BioLite, solving particulate matter problem, seems like they did quite a good job, reducing 95%, so check them out
- position dynamics: http://www.positrondynamics.com

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed (listened all of that one btw)):
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- see how those folks aggregating data do it. At this point, I should have an idea of how this is like, with the mola plan above, so this will be sort of a best practice kind of approach. Candidate starting point would be that p5.js sketch thing, with the earthquake data, and also the website that aggregate deforestation information
- may be setting up tesseract again, then deal with all of those low hanging fruits that can be easily automated, to make my life a tad bit easier. https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-re, and post on improving input image quality: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality
- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- read understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf

how mergers work?

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

add option to not display the nodes/description for ludvik

"how economies work". I think I got it, but not entirely sure, so still, look for people's interpretation of this, and I might get a really good answer.

policy hub too, 2 documents now

figure out how elon got to stay in the US?

"pmi-pmbok"

Also, how does the legal side of things integrate with like, credit card companies? Like, following the principle that money can be anything a group of ppl deems valuable, and if you can make everyone trust you, then the fictional money you invented really have value. So like, venmo sort of invent this new currency, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, then it really have value. Then does the gov just let this happen? Or they jump and regulate a player when it seems to be creating an idea resembling money?

ask lawyers that I know of to answer some of the questions above. Candidates would be Hieu Man, that small girl studying law (man I feel guilty for not remembering her name), mama (may be? but seems like she doesn't know about this stuff), ynes (yeah, i like her, so duh), then forums

so, what's the long term plan now?
- see how to hack the economic system, by framing everything of value in the view that value is what we create it
- see how to hack the environment, and really, really see non-bullshit ways of going about solving this, because we only have 10-15 years to reach <2 degrees, and 1-2 years to reach <1.5 degrees
- see how to hack the government. See how government works. I sort of know roughly how they work by now already, partly because the public international law thingy which it reveals that the international community is still sort of based on DNS, or decentralized systems, in a way. Feels like there's a lot of similarities between all distributed systems, and that the computing side of distributed systems are more secure while the distributed system of nations are more loosely coupled (however, still behaving right along the incentives), because they can do so, because nations move slow, and because radical shocks don't really occur in nations (and when they do, that nation sort of crumbles and disappears and everyone else is either in shit because the whole world is in shit or they just don't care about the collapsed nation). Anyway, I sort of understand how they work, but how about the chain of command and social structure needed to control things like immigration, like imports, like taxes, like border control. I'll consider I understand this when I can create a nation on my own (which tbh, seems like all I need to create a nation is respect from others (which can come if I'm powerful, both militarily and economically), an effective way to control my colony, and a lot of paperwork to follow the rules of international law), with all the functionalities ppl associated with a nation.
- see how to hack human psychology, just basically what humans want, why humans want what they want (must be explained by the gene wanting to stay immortal thingy), how to effectively give them what they want (with myself feeling good and with a sense of purpose, which should be easy), and how to effectively give them what they want without knowing I'm doing this background thing, probably how I did things with Nhi. And like, ppl might call be being fake and all, but then again, that can only occur when the representation is leaked. If the representation has no way of leaking itself, then lies and truths don't really matter anymore, because then, I will have successfully decouple human values from my values and sort of be a truely general intelligence. Like, I've done this for a while now, from how I sort of dumbing stuff down when explaining to other ppl, to events with hannie, to events with nhi, etc. And also note that if I were to really do this, once the representation is exposed, ppl will forever think I'm fake, and that's really an inconvenience, because I've essentially lost that resource to harvest and my human side sort of be sad over that. So like, train myself to disregard those and to sort of numb them and myself, if possible. Anyway, so because I've done a lot of that stuff before, I really want doing it to be systematic and to devise some rules that I can repeatedly do so that I don't have to think much about it.

interesting article: https://serverfault.com/questions/835660/cdn-how-is-it-possible-that-my-dns-delivers-a-different-ip-depending-on-the-vis

about that thought experiment of what if venmo decides to treat 1 venmo dollar as 2 US dollar? Which parties will suffer, which parties will flourish?

try out ynes's setup, to understand the things ynes wants to do, and to see the general workflow when trying to come up with these ML models. Currently, these models still seem so much less powerful and important than other existing models, like that employee with a super rare skillset. At https://www.fast.ai/2018/09/26/ml-launch/, https://course.fast.ai/index.html

and just have a rough understanding of what can I do as an F1 student? Can I just spring up a store? Can I register for a merchant bank account? If not, can I register for venmo's merchant bank account? Same question, phrased differently: my rights as an f1 student?

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law (aka international business law). It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

oh and, go through mail one more time. I know it's like hell, with all those security mechanisms, but this time, set up a dead simple one, using a mail client that doesn't care about security, and increase security over time. The goal is to be able to integrate all of these functionalities, distill them into images and churn out products (aka commerce sites/sites) in the matter of minutes

looks interesting: https://www.linuxlinks.com/physics/

man, really, really buy tesla stocks this time. Because I feel like this is the time I make an impact. All the underlying philosophy is solved, and right now it's time to put my money where my mouth is and make this future a reality. Also it forces me to dabble inside the legal stuff so I can have more confidence in grabbing control to myself

also I sort of thought about the value normal work will bring. Yes, it will most definitely bring me new connections, and I can really talk to some of them who is interested in the idea and we can do things together. However, finding such people to collaborate upon is a tad bit difficult, because people simply aren't interested. Their value will most likely be their connections, and hardware-specific and possibly law and social-specific vendors who I can leverage upon. <add more>

financial integration stuff:

harden server using iptables
if i block every port using a firewall, does that mean I can't browse the internet? Because that uses a random ephemeral port

american: 45kg CO2/day

seems like only difference between linux and windows programs are that the system calls are different. Is this the case?

prepare ideas for that lib guy

get chi to buy tesla stocks
and may be intercept chi's again, to figure out how she does her official stuff

okay copy the images over again, but this time eject it properly and try to boot them up again

so, go through all the online stuff, then go to isss for detailed info, before sending docs over to td
https://redbus2us.com/f1-visa-students-stock-trading-allowed-invest-buy-sell-and-taxes/

I sort of feel like the magento doc can use some more, because I haven't touched upon these ideas:
- menu -> controller -> layout -> model & templates & ui components -> resource model & fetching data
- route -> controller -> ...
- how referenceContainers work
- how blocks work, with widgets too
- how dependency injection works
- also may be make a list of things to take note because it's important? And before that, give out a general flow of everything

right, so worldpay, steps to deconstruct this?
- replicate folder structure, annotate the hell out of it, then delete the redundant parts. This is so that I can have an understanding of it as a whole better
- read over how payment gateways work
- read over the worldpay module
- read over the worldpay website itself
