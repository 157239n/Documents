Hi, I was going through some of the stuff you guys have done and it seems quite good on the surface. However I still kinda have a lot of questions and I couldn't find an FAQ.

1. You listed that you have 2 offices, one in Cape Town, the other in Sydney and you are ready to serve Africa, South East Asia and Australia. But I imagined that there are places where you don't really want to go to, like the deserts of Australia and there are places that you want to go, like peatlands of Indonesia. So do you have a list of places or cities that you want to plant trees in or you just go to where the customer wants?

2. Is there a market for planting trees? My current impression is that the only potential customers are state and charity organizations, and they pay you to rebuild the forest. Is that the case? Are there businesses that want your service? If yes then what might their use case be?

3. Can you write more on your website about your past experiences? Where have you guys worked at? How did it turned out? Because currently it seems like you guys are at the prototyping stage.

Best regards,

Quang
