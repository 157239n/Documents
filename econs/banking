"financial products", offered by banks:

- short-term bond fund
- US savings bonds
- money-market accounts
- money market funds

certificate of deposits, higher interest:
- larger principle
- longer term
- smaller institutions
- personal CD account
- banks and credit unions not insured by FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) or NCUA (National Credit Union Administration), may be they have to pay some quota? FDIC will ensure you never lose the principal
