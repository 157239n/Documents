important problems right now (?):
- development
- human rights
- env

International Criminal Court
Kyoto Protocol
Rio summit

Iraq stuff, 2003
Nuremberg & Tokyo tribunal

international civil society: hundreds of NGOs (non-governmental orgs), concerning:
- env
- women

distinguish:
- actors of international relations: have an impact on international law
  - entities:
    - terrorist groups
    - migrants
  - persons:
    - religious leader
    - prisoner
    - businessman
  - states
  - orgs, like UN, WTO, NATO
  - transnational corps
  - NGOs:
    - amnesty international
- subjects of international law: have legal personality under international law. In addition/contrast to domestic law
  - have rights/obligations under relevant legal order. What matters is have legal capacity to participate in creating new stuff:
    - passive: we don't create it
    - active: we create it
  - can be individuals

"redress mechanisms"

"international investment law" gets mentioned a lot

3 elements characterizes a state (according to Montevideo Convention 1933):
- territory
- population
- effective government
- (extra) Capacity to enter into relations with other States. Some argue this is included in the effective government part

-republic
- monarchy
- federal
- military dictatorship
- liberal democracy

state recognition is sort of voluntary? But there are times when a state is forbidden to recognize another state as a state
recognizing state can add conditions before recognizing

treaty between 2 states does not imply they recognize each other as states
only way to mutually recognize each other is the establishment of diplomatic relations between those 2 states

2012, UN, grants non-member observer state status to Palestine. Doesn't become UN member
state recognition: no special legal effect. Someone high up just said that you're a state bro -> recognizing is more political than legal/juridical
