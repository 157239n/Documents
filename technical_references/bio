list of proteins I wrote down earlier that sounds remotely interesting:
- DNA polymerase
- cap binding complexes
- ribosome subunits
- pseudouridine synthase: Z71568, YNL292w, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi?seqinput=18158779
- mitochondria, atp synthase: NC_012920, 251831106
- methane monooxygenase: CH4 + O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ -> CH3OH + NAD(P)+ + H2O, single bond replacements
- amylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, fibrin, collagen, actin, insulin, potassium channels, luciferase, hemagglutinin, HIV-1 protease, p53 tumor suppressor, cellulases
