So, the only and only 2 ways of storing captured CO2 is:
- saline aquifers
- enhanced oil recovery

Which kinda sucks, because enhanced oil recovery doesn't seem to be able to be net negative emissions.

So validate both of these technologies

"Also there are no commercial BECCS industry. Neither the BE or CCS part has been demonstrated at any serious scale, much less at the scale necessary. The land area needed to grow all that biomass for BECCS in these models is estimated to be around 1 to 3 times the size of India."
