old neuro stuff. Initially was excited because I thought they would have some insights into how human brains actually work, but now seems redundant. May go back on this later on, but for now these are scrapped




alertness, arousal, attention, awareness

cortical columns: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00186/full
reticular activating system
galanin
arcuate fasciculus
melanoma brain metastases

transcranial magnetic stimulation
fusiform face area
middle temporal visual area (V5)
subgenual cingulate cortex

also something seems wrong. Why is the hippocampus so small and the cortex so large? Also why the cerebelum is so dense and the cortex so sparse? And what's the energy efficiency (Landauer's limit) of different parts of the brain?
