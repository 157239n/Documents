Good old Processing

void setup() {}
void settings() {}
void draw() {}

p5js.org, new processing js
function draw() {}
size(x, y) = createCanvas(720, 400)

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('something.jpg');
}
mousePressed -> mouseIsPressed
mouseX, touchX
mouseY, touchY
mousePressed(), touchStarted()
mouseDragged(), touchMoved()
mouseReleased(), touchEnded()
random(100)
let x = new Array(20)



reverse engineering it:
JOGL interface:
- GLEventListener interface
- GLAutoDrawable interface
- GLCanvas class
- GLCapabilities class
- GLProfile class
- GLJPanel class

actually, looks like Processing is just a pleasant wrapper around JOGL lol. You can technically use JOGL for everything, but the interface is absolutely horrible that you can't do anything anymore
