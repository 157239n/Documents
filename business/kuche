rebuild kuche in symfony? Just to get a practice. May be? But like, how about developing my own theme for this, rather than fixing aaika. Just copy the styles and what not, cause it'd be brutal to also understand aaika (this is the main deterent). And check over the comments status of kuche. If there are not many comments, then just, ya know, throw that thing out the window? This is for later. Right now and then just deal with the mail thing

an idea: change computer's hosts file, to replicate the process of actually pointing the kuche domain name to sgn server
