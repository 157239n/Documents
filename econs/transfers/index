transfer money instruments:
- cheque: okay I got the history of it
  - check number: check id, used internally by banks
  - account number: account id, used internally by banks
  - routing number: bank id, used internally by earth
  - idea: the idea is not "money from A to B". The idea is "money from A", then B takes the check to B's bank and tell them to give money into B's specific information.
  - status: uncommon, but still used among the general population

so to know the current balance (of cheques), I have to record every transactions myself, which is tedious

"Visa and MasterCard are well-known names in credit cards, they simply run the proprietary networks through which money (debits and credits) is moved around between the shopper's bank and the merchant's bank, after a transaction"

look into TransferWise or OFX or PayPal's Xoom, a middleman company ("online money transfer companies") that transfer money internationally with good rates. Apparently, ACH networks are separate, and each countries have its own. So wire money is probably the only way to do this
