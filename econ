Opinions:
- Did my BA in ECON. Number 1 thing they teach you is that all our economic models predict how things go with rational thinkers. We as humans are irrational. Everything is devised in a perfect system which is rarely ever the case in reality. Biggest thing to take away is supply = demand in a perfect working market which equates prices to a competitive level. Nowadays with monopolies and large companies controlling multiple parts of production, it's all bullshit. Understand how shortages affect prices or large demands and you'll be good. Graphs are great for explaining and showing theories as well.
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdbbcO35arw) I try my best to dispel this widespread perception.. People have very strong opinions about everything.. Don't spend more than you earn (satire on a board). 95% of economics is common sense. Can you separate economics from politics? ... I have 3 sets of observations to make:
  - Never trust an economist
  - Listen to the other side
  - It's difficult to change economic reality
- Learn the supply and demand curve and you will understand 95% of economics

Classes, old Marxist concept:
- Workers
- Bourgeoisie
- Military
- Clergy
- Royalty
Free-market economics, new, no classes, kinds:
- classical
- neoclassical
- austrian
At least 9 different schools of economics

From Khan Academy (hoping to get a foundation):

Microeconomics and macroeconomics (mostly concern how can policies be formed to incentivise stuff)

Also along the way, see if I can make simulations. Simulations are the only thing that once I do it, it's in my head forever (well may be not cause I'm learning so many different areas, but will improve drastically over not doing them.)

"An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible"
And they often prove to be wrong. In fact, few economist even tend to agree on many of these things

Big idea is scarcity. Scarce resource and free resource. Econ is the study of how to distribute the resources

Scarcity and rivalry, rival good, non-rival good

4 factors of production:
- land, or more broadly, resources
- labor
- capital: tools, machinery, building. Don't include financial assets (gold, money), just "things that were produced in order to produce other things"
- entrepreneurship, act of putting together all the other factors of production so that you can actually produce things. Technology can be grouped into this category. Technology in this context don't really mean computer chips or software

2 things that can be produced:
- capital goods, can be used in some other production processes
- consumption goods, just used
