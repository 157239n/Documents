Are black carbon and soot the same? This is a bit technical and goes into the weeds: https://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/12/24821/2012/acpd-12-24821-2012.pdf
Black carbon's main type: "PM2.5", or particulate matter at 2.5 micrometer or smaller

"Black Carbon's impact on the climate is larger than that of methane and roughly 2/3 that of carbon dioxide", surprising. "460 to 1500 times more potent than CO2 per unit mass. Average lifetime is 4-12 days". Sources of BC:
- In industrialized countries:
  - diesel emissions
  - domestic heating
  - agriculture waste fires
  - in brick kilns. Solution is to convert traditional ones into "vertical shaft brick kilns" (?)
  - flaring. What I can do is to go to these places and put some filters up.
- In developing countries:
  - burning of biomass for cooking and heating
- In Indonesia: from burning peat
- In China and India: 25-35% of the entire world

Considering that Black Carbon is a short-lived pollutant, should we be cautious about that? Just stop doing the dirty stuff (which is possible and is on track) and it will go away literally overnight.

Risks for BC:
- Arctic warmed 1.48 degrees (1976 - 2007), BC is estimated to have caused 0.5-1.4 degrees of that change. So it's still worth trying to reduce this.

How to reduce it?
As far as I've read, the only thing that I can jump in right now is to advise and advocate for better stoves. Almost any stove that's not natural is a better stove.

It appears that emissions in the arctic region is all what people are suggesting nowadays. Makes sense. I still have questions though. Let's say some batch of BC is released in India. Will it be able to travel all the way to the arctic where it can cause harm? If it cannot then why bother fixing the stoves in India? May be ask this to some experts, may be on Quora.
