International law, most currently enforced by International Criminal Court (ICC). Pacts:
- self defense, if someone bullies A then B also joins the fight
- trade, if you don't sell me cheap corn then I won't sell you cheap electronics

Humanitarian organizations:
- Red Cross
- Amnesty International
- Human Rights Watch

Hague Conventions and Geneva conventions: rules of going to war against each other, basically international humanitarian law
- First: 1864
- Civilians can never be targeted or destroying things essential to civilians' survival, to do so is a war crime
- Detainers: prohibit torture of detainees or other ill treatment. Detainees must be given food and water and communication with loved ones. This preserves their dignity and keeps them alive
- Medics: they must always be allowed to do their job. They must not be attacked. Sick and wounded have a right to be cared for regardless of whose side
- Warfare limits: some weapons don't distinguish between fighters and civilians, so limits on weapons use have been agreed



Peoples:
- Rod Bextrum, CEO of ICANN? Global warming policies
- Michael Shellenberger, guy pro nuclear on ted
  - Tried to get Obama to invest $300 bil in renewables
  - 2007, Obama invest $150 bil in clean tech
- James Edward Hansen, entrepreneur working with nuclear. Actually no, he's a NASA climatologist
- Matthew Hansen, researcher guy also at NASA, Uni of Maryland. He is actually quite a big deal in the forestry sector. Almost all papers I've come into cites his papers.
