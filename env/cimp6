ECS: equilibrium climate sensitivity

so ipcc does produce a book for each round of cmip, or in the reports, the assessment reports, called "climate change {year}, physical science basis"

so planning for 5 degrees now, don't just do it for 3 degress anymore, it's pretty unrealistic

2 models:
- physical model, forced by gases
- earth system model, which is the physical one, but with an interactive carbon cycle

coupled model intercomparison project

RCPs:
- 2.6
- 4.5
- 6
- 8.5

cmip is run by the world climate research program project

have to run a small set of fundamental (DECK) experiments:
- amip 
- pre-industrial control run
- 1% per year co2 increase
- abrupt 4x co2 increase

cmip6 provides data:
- duration of runs
- specification of forcing data
	- greenhouse gases, aerosol emissions
	- from observations, or other models (this is the models feeding back into each other thing)
	- drives simulation in desired direction in parameter space
	- differences in results due to differing model performance
- specs disseminated via es-doc, may be this is what the twitter dashboard thing is about. es-doc.oeg
	- also tools to support climate model documentation

data then submitted to earth system grid federation, which is a repo for all data. UK node run by CEDA, center for environmental data analysis

so they start off with a fast, basic model, which is the physical model. There're 2 flavors:
- HadGEM3-GC3.1-N96ORCA1: simple
- HadGEM3-GC3.1-N216ORCA025: complex
then they stick a bunch of other stuff they want to simulate into the simple physical model, like: interactive carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, dynamic vegetation, terrestial nitrogen limitation, ocean biogeochemistry. They call the model UKESM1-N96ORCA1

so, there are multiple N's:
- N96: 130km
- N216, 60km
- N1024, 12km

ocean model resolution:
- 1 degree
- 1/6 degree
- 1/12 degree

okay yeah this is serious. So I mean, pathways to ai still seems to be more important tho. And like, man, the whole southern part is going to be submerged
