Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST):
- 2006-2015: 0.84 degrees
- increasing 0.2 degrees per decade. So in 3 decades, it will hit 1.5 degrees and in 5-6 decades, it will hit 2 degrees

Emissions are unlikely to cause more than 0.5 degrees over the next 2-3 decades???

Radiative forcing:
- Solar radiation: 340W/m^2
Atmosphere is better at absorpbing longer wavelengths of light (radiated light from earth, while light coming in is of shorter wavelengths, which is optical light, i.e visible). Water vapor and CO2 are very good at absorpbing infrared light

Problem:
- hot days: increase 3 degrees (1.5 scenerio) or 4 degrees (2 scenerio). Cold days: increase 4.5 degrees (1.5 scenerio) or 6 degrees (2 scenerio)
- sea level rise: 0.5 meters (1.5 scenerio), 0.6 (2 scenerio)
- 6% reduction in species (1.5 scenerio), 16% reduction in species (2 scenerio)
- Sub-saharan Africa, South East Asia, Central and South America will have crop yield reduced (Breadbaskets, major players: south east asia, germany, ukraine, US, argentina, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/coma/images/issues/200909/map2.jpg)
- 4% of land mass (1.5 scenerio), 13% (2 scenerio) will undergo ecosystem transformation
- 1 ice free arctic ocean per century (1.5 scenerio), at least once per decade (2 scenerio)
- 70-90% coral reefs disappear (1.5 scenerio), 99% disappear (2 scenerio)
- 1.5 mil tonnes lost (1.5 scenerio), 3 mil tonnes (2 scenerio), globally fishery now is 90 mil tonnes
- Areas of risk: arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states, least developed countries. Also, hundreds of millions of ppl will be better (in poverty) if we keep things to 1.5.
- Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics to experience largest impacts on economic growth. Subtropics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_locations_with_a_subtropical_climate. Okay so Vietnam kinda lies right in the center of it lol.

Reasons for concern (RFC, lol): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_for_concern
- RFC 1: high to very high risk, unique and threatened systems
- RFC 2: moderate to high risk, extreme weather events
- RFC 3: moderate to high risk, distribution of impacts
- RFC 4: moderate to high risk, global aggregate impacts
- RFC 5: moderate to high risk, large scale singular event
The fact that all of these RFCs are moderate to high risk or above is again, kinda scary
Impacks and risks (things that will fucked up so bad) from RFCs: Warm water corals, arctic region, coastal flooding

Pathsways:
- 1.5 degree target:
  - 2030: 55% 2010
  - 2050: net zero
- 2 degree target:
  - 2030: 75% 2010
  - 2070: net zero
For non-CO2 factors, it has to be agressive like CO2 in the 2 degrees scenerio to achieve the 1.5 target

also that sulfur aerosol plan to inject it into the stratosphere

Nitty gritty details:
- steep reductions: methane and black carbon (?). 2050: 35% the level at 2010
- nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture. How? I mean, plants need nitrogen right? So how can one produce fertilizer without producing nitrous oxide?
- hydrofluorocarbons
- high bioenergy demand can increase emisions of nitrous oxide

Remaining carbon budget (integral from here to when net neutral carbon emissions is achieved):
- 1.5 degrees: 2200 +- 320 GtCO2

However, AR5 estimates that 50% probability of limiting to 1.5 degrees is confined in a carbon budget of 580 GtCO2

Current rate: CO2 only: 42 GtCO2/yr, combined: 52 eGtCO2/yr, which is kinda scary

Carbon budget in-depth:
- https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-the-ipcc-1-5c-report-expanded-the-carbon-budget
- https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c

Permafrost thawing could reduce budget by 100 GtCO2

More common name for CCUS: CDR, or carbon dioxide removal. Official names for the others:
BECCS: Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
AFOLU: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
