visit a geothermal plant

look into this:

Valuable image: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Ragone-plot-of-various-battery-technologies-with-specification-at-cell-level-for_fig1_258177713

Again, look into this Andrew Yang guy, for the renewables and such
look over to see whether this is worthy: https://aiesec.org/global-volunteer

some other reports:
- https://www.iea.org/etp/explore/
- https://www.iea.org/etp2017/

compile a list of interesting points about climate change to talk with that librarian:
- trees absorb 3kg CO2 per year, aggregate: 9GtCO2/yr. Today it's 40GtCO2/yr
- reality check on renewables

John Englander's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvqY2NcBWI8. Watched it, but he mentions 2 times about Vietnam, which is a very specific thing to talk about. So see what he has been doing because I'm pretty scared when he say that.
International Sea Level Institute.
Sanan Sino-Science, chinese comp that plant trees in doors, price 11 times higher than the market average. No pescitides needed, and not much water needed too

Also dig into hydroponics and aquaponics

how water works, mesopotamia, 691 BCE

how waste management works
also how to futureproof myself
how to contract out for a whole factory?
so the guts of mechanical engineering is to be damn precise and to be rigid

about the climate stuff. What resources do I have an infinite amount of that I can rely on? I have been taking electricity for granted

"permaculture gardens"
aeroponics
aquaponics

"climate change without bullshit". Important article to go through: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/climate-change-global-warming-scenarios-ambition

Familiarize myself with permits and environmental regulations that are floating around in the world right now.

To understand the supply chain and how can I affect it, look for ways to mitigate palm oil.

Also see how can solar panels are mass produced, what are the remaining challenges, (or any). Also see whether it will solve the electricity problem in full (meaning I can clearly see a path, and measure progress on that path) as I thought it would. If not then I'll have to reevaluate my plan

Also see the process of how oil refineries work, how pumpjacks work to the point as if I'm visiting it. Do the same for those industries that I care so much about, like ethanol, steel and cement. Do the same for a solar plant like Andasol.

Also understand the perspective of a climate scientists doing these things too. Examples would be Hayhoe (obvious), Laura Iraci, Rama Nemani, Matthew Hansen
Thomas Friedman
Susan Rice, us national security advisor

So what's the carrying capacity for the human race? Figured out the figures for energy usage and whatnot already. What's left is figuring out the ballpark of some other stuff, like land use and whatnot

Now it kinda feels the whole field is a bit toxic, because like, it appears that we have exceeded our carrying capacity and further advocacy might as well tank the world's economy

green new deal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxIDJWCbk6I

In light of drawdown, how about I discuss it with a lot of people, hold conferences at many different places and also change the textbook?

vn energy outlook: https://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Globalcooperation/Official_docs/Vietnam/vietnam-energy-outlook-report-2017-eng.pdf

some recycling stats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxaN_xqQh4

so I guess what I wanted to do about climate through all of these investigation might be giving out suggestions to improve stuff

read the 14 pages of the green new deal

Also I still don't get the interface for climate change. I mean, the common technical language ppl talk with each other in the field, so dig into that.

wtf is this https://americas.ramboll.com/projects

ocean related climate stuff:

- Speak Up for Blue

"carbon sequestration through ecosystem restoration", another term for CCUS

why was there apparently no action against climate in the gov area? Why has tries over the past couple of decades seemingly vanish?
ecotourism

"business cases for mitigation and adaption in climate"

Global thermostat, Prometheus, Carbon engineering

Research about the viability of nuclear. So tech seems okay. What about the money? Profile several nuclear plants

Global climate action summit (9 hours long summit lol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxHDD_pLf0

Dry electrode coating technology: http://www.powersourcesconference.com/Power%20Sources%202018%20Digest/docs/3-1.pdf

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year, 3M exajoules/year, plants capture 3k exajoules/yr, human activities 500 exajoules/yr
467kWh - 1.2tr
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit
also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things
american: 45kg CO2/day
