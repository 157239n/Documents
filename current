So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN, check out docs for robinhood

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year, 3M exajoules/year, plants capture 3k exajoules/yr, human activities 500 exajoules/yr
467kWh - 1.2tr
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed (listened all of that one btw)):
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- read understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf

how mergers work?

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

Also, how does the legal side of things integrate with like, credit card companies? Like, following the principle that money can be anything a group of ppl deems valuable, and if you can make everyone trust you, then the fictional money you invented really have value. So like, venmo sort of invent this new currency, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, then it really have value. Then does the gov just let this happen? Or they jump and regulate a player when it seems to be creating an idea resembling money?

ask lawyers that I know of to answer some of the questions above. Candidates would be Hieu Man, that small girl studying law (man I feel guilty for not remembering her name), mama (may be? but seems like she doesn't know about this stuff), ynes (yeah, i like her, so duh), then forums

- see how to hack human psychology, just basically what humans want, why humans want what they want (must be explained by the gene wanting to stay immortal thingy), how to effectively give them what they want (with myself feeling good and with a sense of purpose, which should be easy), and how to effectively give them what they want without knowing I'm doing this background thing, probably how I did things with Nhi. And like, ppl might call be being fake and all, but then again, that can only occur when the representation is leaked. If the representation has no way of leaking itself, then lies and truths don't really matter anymore, because then, I will have successfully decouple human values from my values and sort of be a truely general intelligence. Like, I've done this for a while now, from how I sort of dumbing stuff down when explaining to other ppl, to events with hannie, to events with nhi, etc. And also note that if I were to really do this, once the representation is exposed, ppl will forever think I'm fake, and that's really an inconvenience, because I've essentially lost that resource to harvest and my human side sort of be sad over that. So like, train myself to disregard those and to sort of numb them and myself, if possible. Anyway, so because I've done a lot of that stuff before, I really want doing it to be systematic and to devise some rules that I can repeatedly do so that I don't have to think much about it.

about that thought experiment of what if venmo decides to treat 1 venmo dollar as 2 US dollar? Which parties will suffer, which parties will flourish?

and just have a rough understanding of what can I do as an F1 student? Can I just spring up a store? Can I register for a merchant bank account? If not, can I register for venmo's merchant bank account? Same question, phrased differently: my rights as an f1 student?

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law (aka international business law). It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

financial integration stuff:
- companies:
	- square
	- wallet.google.com
	- braintree, which sounds familiar enough. Heck, there's even a prebuilt Magento module, so it must be quite big
	- paypal:
