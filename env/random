Reality check on renewables ted talk (David MacKay, "Sustainable energy - without the hot air", chief science advisor to UK Dept. of Energy and Climate Change):

UK energy consumption: 125kWh per day per person:
- 40 for transport
- 40 for heating
- 40 for electricity
- others

Top of the line countries: 2.5W/m^2 (each day). This level is what we should aim for to provide to the world
Wind power: 2.5W/m^2
Solar PV: 5-20W/m^2 for UK, can climb to 60W/m^2 for deserts. Assuming 15-20% efficiency
Concentrating solar power: 15-20W/m^2
Nuclear: 1000W/m^2
Sunlight: 342W/m^2 world average per day per m^2 of earth's surface. 1368W/m^2 for direct sunlight for a circle (not spherical) earth. 110W/m^2 in UK (32%), 250W/m^2 in deserts (73%)

Andasol Solar Power Station: Europe's first parabolic trough power plant, 10W/m^2
- Solar radiance/insolation: 250W/m^2 (quoted as "exceptionally high"), but totaling around 97W/m^2 only, so 38% efficiency
Other plants (check out https://www.youtube.com/user/beyondzeroemissions/videos btw)? Btw the promotional vid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsLnIYKo-qk) of that plant looks so cool you know. What's the profession there called?

Transport:
- Normal car: 80kWh per 100km
- Electric car (go check with Tesla on this one): 15kWh per 100km
- Train: 3-6kWh per 100km
- Motorcycle (go check with numbers from a large pool of Vietnamese motorcycles): 3kWh per 100km
- Bicycle: 1kWh per 100km

For battery, losees 20-40% when put electricity in and out (so 10-20% when put in and take out individually)

Denmark and Germany has maxed out area for wind and solar

Concentrations:
- CO2: 405 ppm (2017)
- CO2e: 490 ppm
- Highest before: around 295 ppm at 125k years ago

Planning to operation delays:
- Of nuclear: 120 gCO2e/kWh
- Wind, CSP: 10 gCO2e/kWh
- Solar PV: 45 gCO2e/kWh

Electricity rates, some say solar is 1.79 cent/kWh:

Oil prices:
- Crude oil: $0.45/L
- Automotive diesel: $1/L
- Gasoline: $1/L

"Electricity from solar roof tops costing 2 times more than electricity from farms"
house cats kill billions of birds every year, while hundred thousand from wind turbines

Lignite, kinda like coal

CO2 concentrations and past data:
- 300ppm -> 1-2 degress increase, 125k million years ago
- 400ppm -> 2-3.5 degrees increase, 3-5 million years ago
- 1000ppm -> 10 degress increase, 50 mollion years ago. Little ice, sea level at least 60 meters higher than currently. So probably the thing about feedback loops to - cause 200 meters of sea level rise is kinda bullshit

612k
439k
413k
373k
832k

India pledged before Paris to build 30 nuclear plants, while they are planning to build 5 only

Gasses outlawed by Kyoto protocol:
- CO2
- CH4
- Nitrous Oxide
- Hydrofluorocarbons. Oh, the thing in refrigeration mentioned in project Drawdown. 5000-10000 times more powerful than CO2
- Perfluorocarbons
- Sulfur Hexafluoride

effects of CO2: 500k atomic bombs a day, or 5/sec

"House of Green in Denmark", have report that fossil fuel usage has not declined (but not increased), despite wind generates 115% of the energy needs
