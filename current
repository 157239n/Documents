So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN, check out docs for robinhood

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

I guess I wanted to learn about automation is to know if I can build my own factory/plant. If I can, and if I know how professional stuff are done there, I can out source it effectively, and at the same time manage the money flow too.

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year

How about the science left to do with Lithium and Lithium ion batteries?

Kickstarter: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7lzqyo/anyone_have_experience_with_kickstarter_tips/

get into the mining and petrochemical industry. Also play satisfactory to begin to appreciate the size of these industrial machines, also the interconnections between them. https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/satisfactory/home. Did so, but it seems like this view of full automation is kind of misleading, because in the real world, we do not have the freedom of picking up factories and ploping them down. We have a preconceived idea of how the factory is structured, how things move in and out, and there is typically only 1 main assembling line. Other improvements are about efficiency, speed-wise. So it's really, really different from the type of scaling in satisfactory or in factorio.

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

467kWh - 1.2tr

i guess what i am looking for is "manufacturing and supply chain", which nha's books kinda gives me the foundations

okay, so I got the heavy industries down. I know what machines are there, how do these pieces fit together. Now see the same for the semiconductor industry, and what's the deal with all of those substrates, the doping and the etching? Also how metal working works, and how foundaries work too. For this, may be look for yt channels like king of random or night hawk

for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

also metals scarcity seems to be a thing too. So dig into that

so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

doug ellison, amature guy, eventually works in jpl, uses data from nasa, the freely accessible ones

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

see over chi's new lab reports and understand the chemistry she's currently involved in.

an interesting challenge that I think will be in the right step to understand the true solutions to climate change would be to do the terraformed mars thing, or at least look into casey's work and figure out how it works. Then use the data available for earthquakes and other stuff like tree tops, aggregated from satellites and whatnot to visualize and put together all of these data.

company provisioning:
- d-rev
- windpax
- BioLite, solving particulate matter problem, seems like they did quite a good job, reducing 95%, so check them out, see if they're successful
- position dynamics: http://www.positrondynamics.com

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, play factorio to get the scaling challenges, then may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed):
- get the mola mars data (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter), then fill 'em up with water, to probe at the actual scale of a planet, then try to read over casey's work to see how he does his simulation
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then do actual simulations of cfd
- see how those folks aggregating data do it. At this point, I should have an idea of how this is like, with the mola plan above, so this will be sort of a best practice kind of approach. Candidate starting point would be that p5.js sketch thing, with the earthquake data, and also the website that aggregate deforestation information
- then see over other nasa's dataset, preferably about earth and start to dive deep into the current state of climate stuff, because I still don't entirely get it
- may be setting up tesseract again, then deal with all of those low hanging fruits that can be easily automated, to make my life a tad bit easier. https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-re, and post on improving input image quality: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality
- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- then the story of energy
- read understanding earth
- read rocket propulsion elements
- Understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf

so may be, create a program that can beat window's chess engine. This would sort of reintroduces some of the important ideas for dealing with mola

how mergers work?

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

https://pitmonticone.github.io/rcp85-debate/

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

add option to not display the nodes/description for ludvik

"how economies work". I think I got it, but not entirely sure, so still, look for people's interpretation of this, and I might get a really good answer.

so, goal for today:
- go through with the rest of the magento book. After finishing the theme part, reread everything
- IBM Transact thing
- this too: https://www.reddit.com/r/Magento/comments/97umqo/is_it_worth_getting_into_magento_2_for_a_medium/

policy hub too, 2 documents now

figure out how elon got to stay in the US?

also see over how public talking works, what venues I can penetrate into
find that place/club where chi can practice speaking and singing

okay, for the international law thing, I'm starting to not understand it. So, go through them from the beginning and now, branch out and read a bunch of stuff about them, may be read stuff from preexisting logs as well

"pmi-pmbok"

kay, so let's stop the magento bit for a sec, to make it eat into my brain. So now, let's go over the web security thing, and after finishing the book entirely, go back to the layout and whatnot

yikes. Let's see the twitter stuff again. Now I believe I can really do this without feeling adhoc and out of place. So yeah. let's just do that, and make the gravity art thingy from before.
