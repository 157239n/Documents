So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN, check out docs for robinhood

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year, 3M exajoules/year, plants capture 3k exajoules/yr, human activities 500 exajoules/yr
467kWh - 1.2tr
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

doug ellison, amature guy, eventually works in jpl, uses data from nasa, the freely accessible ones

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

carbon xprize
TerraPower, travelling wave reactor

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

company provisioning:
- d-rev
- windpax
- BioLite, solving particulate matter problem, seems like they did quite a good job, reducing 95%, so check them out
- position dynamics: http://www.positrondynamics.com

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed (listened all of that one btw)):
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- read understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf

how mergers work?

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

"how economies work". I think I got it, but not entirely sure, so still, look for people's interpretation of this, and I might get a really good answer.

"pmi-pmbok"

Also, how does the legal side of things integrate with like, credit card companies? Like, following the principle that money can be anything a group of ppl deems valuable, and if you can make everyone trust you, then the fictional money you invented really have value. So like, venmo sort of invent this new currency, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, then it really have value. Then does the gov just let this happen? Or they jump and regulate a player when it seems to be creating an idea resembling money?

ask lawyers that I know of to answer some of the questions above. Candidates would be Hieu Man, that small girl studying law (man I feel guilty for not remembering her name), mama (may be? but seems like she doesn't know about this stuff), ynes (yeah, i like her, so duh), then forums

so, what's the long term plan now?
- see how to hack the environment, and really, really see non-bullshit ways of going about solving this, because we only have 10-15 years to reach <2 degrees, and 1-2 years to reach <1.5 degrees
- see how to hack human psychology, just basically what humans want, why humans want what they want (must be explained by the gene wanting to stay immortal thingy), how to effectively give them what they want (with myself feeling good and with a sense of purpose, which should be easy), and how to effectively give them what they want without knowing I'm doing this background thing, probably how I did things with Nhi. And like, ppl might call be being fake and all, but then again, that can only occur when the representation is leaked. If the representation has no way of leaking itself, then lies and truths don't really matter anymore, because then, I will have successfully decouple human values from my values and sort of be a truely general intelligence. Like, I've done this for a while now, from how I sort of dumbing stuff down when explaining to other ppl, to events with hannie, to events with nhi, etc. And also note that if I were to really do this, once the representation is exposed, ppl will forever think I'm fake, and that's really an inconvenience, because I've essentially lost that resource to harvest and my human side sort of be sad over that. So like, train myself to disregard those and to sort of numb them and myself, if possible. Anyway, so because I've done a lot of that stuff before, I really want doing it to be systematic and to devise some rules that I can repeatedly do so that I don't have to think much about it.

about that thought experiment of what if venmo decides to treat 1 venmo dollar as 2 US dollar? Which parties will suffer, which parties will flourish?

and just have a rough understanding of what can I do as an F1 student? Can I just spring up a store? Can I register for a merchant bank account? If not, can I register for venmo's merchant bank account? Same question, phrased differently: my rights as an f1 student?

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law (aka international business law). It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

man, really, really buy tesla stocks this time. Because I feel like this is the time I make an impact. All the underlying philosophy is solved, and right now it's time to put my money where my mouth is and make this future a reality. Also it forces me to dabble inside the legal stuff so I can have more confidence in grabbing control to myself

also I sort of thought about the value normal work will bring. Yes, it will most definitely bring me new connections, and I can really talk to some of them who is interested in the idea and we can do things together. However, finding such people to collaborate upon is a tad bit difficult, because people simply aren't interested. Their value will most likely be their connections, and hardware-specific and possibly law and social-specific vendors who I can leverage upon. <add more>

may be read through tesla quarterly reports?

check over my health insurance

see how coupons work in heirloom

"stores and rewards cards", and "rewards credit card", 1-5% back in cash/points. Dig more into this. Is this just a normal credit card, or is it a specific card for a specific store

ask chi about switchable mechanically interlocked macromolecular architectures (MIMA) and like, I sort of want to know what's available now

data from aukehostra. Not necessarily have to build programs to scratch through this, but to get the idea of how things are like, aka status update

and, how about 2020 year? Do I get another W-2 for that?

"in order to increase the number of potential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, europeans truned ot limited liability joint-stock companies"

read Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, just to take in the concrete ideas of UBI? Reviews said that the latter half is good

w2 2020?

so, flow of everything (draw.io to do that)? Does worldpay actually polls the url exposed?

writing tests seems important, but only when I setup my own thing with the database. I still disagree with mocks and stubs strongly

i still want to do the old schema thingy. Not with router, but with experimenting with a real database, resetting its schema and whatnot

do i really need that query string append? let's try to remove that and see if it affects anything

"pdo db connection", this is mentioned a lot
