	syslog (debian), messages (rhel)
	auth.log (debian), secure (rhel)

	kern
	dmesg: device driver messages
	faillog: failed logins
	daemon.log
	btmp: all failed login attempts
	utmp: current login state
	wtmp: record of each login/logout
	lastlog: every user's last login

logging categories:
- application logs
- event logs
- service logs
- system logs

levels:
- emergency: emergency condition, like imminent system crash, usually broadcast to all users
- alert: should be corrected immediately, like a corrupted system database
- crit: critical condition, like hardware error
- err: ordinary error
- warning
- notice: not an error, but should be handled in a special way
- info
- debug

syslog is a standard for creating and transmitting logs
- syslog service. Listens for events at /dev/log and applications can write into that. Implementations:
	- rsyslogd
	- syslog-ng
- syslog protocol (RFC 5424), specify how logs are to be transported over a network. Also data format. Ports:
	- 514: plaintext
	- 6514: encrypted
- syslog message, any log formatted in the syslog message format. Consists of standardized header and message containing the log's contents

syslog format:
Jun 4 22:14:15 server1 sshd[41458] : Failed password for root from 10.0.2.2 port 22 ssh2
<34>1 2019-06-05T22:14:15.003Z server1 sshd - - pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=10.0.2.2

elements:
- timestamp
- hostname
- app-name: "sshd:auth"
- priority: "<34>", 2 parts to it. First part is facility, second is severity. 2 formats: 8*facility+severity or facility.severity
- facility: type of process that created the event. 0 (kernel messages) -> 23 (local application)
- severity: 0 (emergency) -> 7 (debug)

commands:
- logger:
	- message: writes into /var/log/syslog. Can have the `command` thingy
	- -f file: reads what's in the file and logs it
	- --size 10: limits every line to 10 characters. Still logs the full input tho
- newsyslog
- logrotate, should be called by a cron daemon
- systemctl
	- list-unit-files --type service
	- list-units --type service --state=running
	- list-dependencies <service unit file>
	- --failed
- systemd-analyze: time taken by the boot process
	- blame: blame on what service takes the longest to boot (currently it's docker of over 40 seconds)
- journalctl
	- --disk-usage
	- --vacuum-size=200M: limit everything to 200M
	- --verify: if there are any coruptions

journalctl config params:
- compress
- systemkeepfree
- runtimekeepfree
- systemmaxfilesize
- runtimemaxfilesize
- maxretentionsec
- maxfilesec
