credit scores and credit reports, order from agencies for a fee. Systems:
- Equifax's BEACON
- TransUnion's FICO Risk Score
- Experian's Experian/Fair Isaac RISK
credit score bandwagon:
- landlords
- merchants
- employers
- insurance companies. Slightly modified version, "insurance score", cuz ppl don't see the connection between insurance and credit
how and where do they do credit scores? How does that work across multiple banks? What is the process of actually getting one. I think I will understand this after I have understand credit enough
