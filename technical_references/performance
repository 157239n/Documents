10700k, advertised performance: 30 GFLOPS/core

SIMD option: -march=native

practical performance:
- dummy sum: 2 nested for loops. Inner one lots, outer one not as much, progress printing outer
	- C: 6 GFLOPS (0.6 GFLOPS unoptimized). SIMD: 20 GFLOPS
	- Python: 12 MFLOPS
	- Cython: 2.6 GFLOPS. SIMD: 5 GFLOPS
- buffered writes: 2 nested for loops, writes into a buffer space
	- C: 0.1 GFLOPS
	- Python: 9.3 MFLOPS

expectations:
- 50x less performance than advertised, for C
- 50x less performance than C, for Python

sequence alignment:
- 18%, 82s
