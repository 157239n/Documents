goals for this trip?
- demonstrate plasmid cloning. Heard it's super simple and whatnot
- understand the compliment system designs, and see if I can come up with comparable systems
- try to run AlphaFold2. Also try to figure out the energy landscape in a few structures: https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/alphafold_casp13
- try to infect cells with modified virus with a specific payload
