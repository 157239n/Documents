okay, so I got the heavy industries down. I know what machines are there, how do these pieces fit together. Now see the same for the semiconductor industry, and what's the deal with all of those substrates, the doping and the etching? Also how metal working works, and how foundaries work too. For this, may be look for yt channels like king of random or night hawk

also metals scarcity seems to be a thing too. So dig into that

get into the mining and petrochemical industry. Also play satisfactory to begin to appreciate the size of these industrial machines, also the interconnections between them. https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/satisfactory/home. Did so, but it seems like this view of full automation is kind of misleading, because in the real world, we do not have the freedom of picking up factories and ploping them down. We have a preconceived idea of how the factory is structured, how things move in and out, and there is typically only 1 main assembling line. Other improvements are about efficiency, speed-wise. So it's really, really different from the type of scaling in satisfactory or in factorio.

How about the science left to do with Lithium and Lithium ion batteries?
