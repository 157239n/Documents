  - employer pays half
- 1099: contract: contract employed or self imployed
  - pay less tax
  - can write off expenses: office space, internet bill, cell phone bill, business trip, office supplies



and again, to be honest here, it feels as if people are just lost in trying to avoid taxes and not looking for better ways to do this
I mean, you can spend more to avoid tax, and do contract work, and then employed work, but like dude, what's wrong with you? You are devoting so much time of your own to avoiding taxes when you can just use that to scale up production to do something really meaningful. Just keep that money and do things that are important to you.

contract work = temporary work, or at least how they called it

Tom - 20 hrs, 25k, spent all
- Wife: 0
Dick - 40 hrs, 50k, spent all
- Wife: 25k
Harry - 60 hrs, 100k, invested in stocks and bonds
- Wife: 50k
