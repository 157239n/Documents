Ocean acidification (surface water): 8.21 dropped to 8.10, which actually means 30% increase in acidity

CO2 + H2O <-> H2CO3 <-> H + HCO3 <-> H + H + CO3
CO2: 1%
HCO3: 92%
CO3: 7%

More CO2 in the ocean, CaCO3 turns into Ca(HCO3)2 to hold in more of that carbon and thus will damage sea creatures.

Also CaCO3 is kinda like the basic buffer in oceans.


20 meters/degree celsius
1993 - 1997: 1.5mm/yr
1998 - 2011: 3.2mm/yr
2012 - 2018: 5mm/yr

watch out for 6 glaciers, 3 meters of sea level locked up, and we can't predict how fast it's going to melt, like Cali's earthquakes:
- Pine Island
- Thwaites
- Haynes
- Pope
- Smith
- Kohler
All of these glacier is in West Antartic btw
