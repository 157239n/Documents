# Windows keyboard shortcuts

### General rules

- `Shift` means reverse. `Shift` `Tab` means undo a `Tab`, so `Shift` `Tab` `Tab` does nothing.
- `Ctrl` gives you much control of everything. Generally works the same across applications.
- `Alt` means alternative, which extends the role of `Ctrl`. Generally have no pattern across applications and it's quite hard to lern this.

### Dealing with window positions

- Maximize a window: `Win` `↑`
- Minimize a window: `Win` `↓`. Return to normal if currently maximized
- Dock a window to the left: `Win` `←`
- Dock a window to the right: `Win` `→`
- Move a window: `Alt` `Space`, selects `Move` and use arrow keys to move the window, `Enter` to stop moving
- Resize a window: `Alt` `Space`, selects `Size`, press `↓` `→` and use arrow keys to size the window, `Enter` to stop resizing
- Minimize all windows with animation: `Win` `M`
- Minimize all windows without animation and focus on the desktop (recommended): `Win` `D`
- Switch between windows: `Alt` `Tab` or `Alt` `Shift` `Tab`

### Window options

- Focus on the application's menu: `Alt`
- Shows a list of actions with the window: `Alt` `Space`
- Close a window: `Ctrl` `W` or `Alt` `F4`

### Taskbar

- Open an application in the nth place: `Win` `<number>`, like `Win` `1`
- Open window explorer: `Win` `E`
- Focus on the taskbar: `Win` `T`
