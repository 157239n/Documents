Units: Watt is energy flow, Joules, or Watt-seconds is energy

So, CCS deployment is essential. Currently, 40 bil tons are dumped every year, plants can carry ~ 30mil tons per year
Also, what about the tax schema? How much tax is needed for a smooth transition?
Natural solutions like trees, 37% of efforts only

45Q tax credit, incentivize industries doing CCS

Climeworks, a Switzerland-based startup

Climeworks is one of three startups—along with Carbon Engineering in Canada and Global Thermostat in the US—to have shown the technology is feasible

In virtually every IPCC model, carbon capture is absolutely essential—no matter what else we do to mitigate climate change.

Over the past decade, billions of dollars have been spent on carbon-capture projects that have not materialized. The most recent failure was the $7.5 billion Kemper Project in Mississippi

Today, about 30% of total world energy (and 40% of the world’s electricity) is supplied by coal

+-80$/metric ton of CO2

Starting in 2000, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act

Total global solar installation is 300GW in 2016 (1%), while actual output is 150GW (iea sankey)

3700MW = 3 mil US households (7.8mil ppl). This kinda checks out as US person consumes 5.5 times more than the world's average.

The project, operated by two energy companies, the US’s NRG and Japan’s JX Nippon, was christened “Petra Nova,” which means “new oil” in Latin.

with the capacity to capture more than 90% of its emissions, about 1.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year. It cost $1 billion to build, $190 million of which came from the US government.

Petra Nova does all five steps of carbon capture and storage (CCS): generating carbon dioxide, capturing the emissions (which is a two-part process), transporting it to where it will be stored, and injecting it deep underground and then monitoring it.

$2 million for each mile of CO2 pipeline

“enhanced oil recovery”, or pumping CO2 to dissolve into the oil to extract more of them

Every time CO2 is pumped into the oil field, about 20% of the gas remains underground. The rest comes back up to the surface with the oil

Petra Nova $50/barrel

Oil companies currently pump about 68 million metric tons of CO2 into oil fields in the US every year. Only 25% of that comes from capturing emissions from human-made sources. The primary source of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery today is—I kid you not—naturally occurring CO2 fields.

Saline aquifers instead of enhanced oil recovery

A typical coal plant produces about three million tons of the gas per year.

Some statistics (unit: WPP = world percent per people):
- Jap: 0.04/(126 * 10^6) = 0.032 * 10^-8 = 3.2 * 10^-10 WPP
- China: 0.3/(1.4 * 10^9) = 2.14 * 10^-10 WPP
- America: 0.15/(325 * 10^6) = 0.04 * 10^-8 = 4 * 10^-10 WPP
- India: 0.07/(1.4 * 10^9) = 5 * 10^-11 WPP
- Russian Federation: 0.05/(144 * 10^6) = 0.035 * 10^-8 = 3.5*10^-10 WPP

So the real problem is for the developed countries. If a solution is not found that can sustain the developed countries, then developing countries are hopeless





So, let's forget all of these and just agree to find a way to implement BECCUS at the 10-100 GtCO2/yr scale. Here are links which I might want to return in the future:

Types of electric generators:
- Automotive engines, 25% efficient
- Supercritical coal-fired power station, 45% efficient
- Steam-cooled combined cycle gas turbine
