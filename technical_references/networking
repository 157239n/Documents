Networking
802.3an = 10Gbps (for LAN, set out by IEEE), 10GBASE-T (10gb baseband (digital signal, vs broadband, which is analog), T = UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable (LX, another type of cable, which is fiber optic))
What's the theoretical maximum for transfer rate?

Cat5 (100Mbps), Cat5e (1Gbps), Cat6 (10Gbps up to 55m), Cat6a (10Gbps up to 100m), Cat7 cables

RJ45 connector. EIA/TIA 568b. Straight through and Cross over connections. Auto MDI-X works for <1Gbps

1000BASE-TX or 1000BASE-T

fiber optic cables: Single Mode Fibre vs Multi Mode Fibre
802.11 (Wifi)

2 addresses:
- MAC, 1 every network card (thus, a computer can have multiple network cards), permanently assigned, "burned in address"
- IP

OSI model:
- Application
- Presentation
- Session (big upwards)
- Transport (small downwards)
- Network
- Data link, Logical Link Control and Media Access Control sub layers
- Physical

Header and trailer

Session control protocol

CRC, aka error correcting information

So, computer -> switch -> router -> switch -> another router -> switch -> another computer

Classes for IP addresses:
- A: Device, 1-3, large networks, small number of networks, but with enourmous hosts. First bit is always 0, so there are 2^7 networks possible. 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0, but 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.0 is reserved -> so there are only 2^7 - 2 networks
- B: Device, 2-2, medium networks. First 2 bits are always 10 -> 2^14 possible networks and 2^16 hosts. 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
- C: Device, 3-1, small networks. First 3 bits are always 110 -> 2^21 possible networks (~2M) and 2^8 hosts. 192.0.0.0 to 223.225.225.0
- D: Multicast, 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
- E: Reserved for special purposes

Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
CIDR notation: 172.16.1.0 /24 (/24 represents subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, or the first 24 bits of the ip address is turned on)

Variable length subnet mask (VLSM), conserve even more ip addresses

Boardcast ips, with max host number. Global boardcast ip: 255.255.255.255
"network address", with min host number

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns addresses to Regional Internet Registries (RIR)
RIRs assign space to ISPs and large customers. ISPs give addresses to smaller customers

RFC 1918, some IP spaces are now reserved for private use, like:
- 10.0.0.0 /8
- 172.16.0.0 /12
- 192.168.0.0 /16

When sent from a home network, the banned (private) IP addresses will be converted to a public address (Network Address Translation)

DHCP server

Video server sends traffic to multicast IP. Other hosts look for traffic sent to that IP. Routers forwards multicast

Okay, so shouldn't the IP header section on IP addresses also have a subnet mask?

Random source port: 1024 - 65535


Router:

GE 0/0/1: gigabit ethernet module 0 port 0. The "1" is the index of the opening. Each module has 4 openings, and each opening has an RJ45 style port and sfp transceivers (usually for fiber optic cables)
- Management port
- 2 USB ports, for firmware update
- 2 console ports, 1 mini usb, the other RJ45 connector
- Auxiliary port, old days

Serial, baud rate, all the good stuff from the arduino times
Router>enable (user exec mode, limited)
Router# (priviledged exec mode)
Commands:
- enable
- show ...
  - show clock
  - show version
  - show ?
  - show clock ?
- configure terminal (enter configuration mode, global exec commands won't work, like show clock. Do this using "do show clock")
- hostname Internet-Router (change hostname of device while in config mode)
- exit
- show ip interface brief
- (config)interface gigabit 0/1 ("gigabit 0/1" because when executed show ip interface brief, the tut has 2 rows, "GigabitEthernet0/0" and "GigabitEthernet0/1")
- (config-if)description Corporate Network
- (config-if)ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
- (config-ip)shutdown
- (config-ip)no shutdown (turn a command/config off)
- (global)show interface description









internet <- modem <- router <- firewall <- switch <- computer
