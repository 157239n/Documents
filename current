So, plan to deal with this whole problem:
- (done) Learn about the remaining IT stuff: Docker and Gradle
- (done) Learn about networking and possibly wiggle around the Raspberry Py to understand more
- Learn about some mechanical engineering stuff, to the point that I have a feeling and intuition for stresses and strains
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.
- Buy Tesla stocks once I get the SSN

So what's the carrying capacity for the human race?

Now it kinda feels the whole field is a bit toxic, because like, it appears that we have exceeded our carrying capacity and further advocacy might as well tank the world's economy

green new deal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxIDJWCbk6I

question to ask chi:
- what are all the toys, how can they be used? How about an example of a different research direction using those same types of toys?
- what are the equivalent of these toys that are used in the industry? How about an example outside of academic research that use these toys? Do they even use these toys at all?
- what's the research exactly about? Get into the nitty gritty details
- now suppose that the research has reached its goals, how can it be approved for mass consumption
- how does employment in that field works
- how the research is financed, what's the whole stuff with "defending your dissertation" looks like?

Also understand the perspective of a climate scientists doing these things too. Examples would be Hayhoe (obvious), Laura Iraci, Rama Nemani, Matthew Hansen
Thomas Friedman
Susan Rice, us national security advisor

Also see the process of how oil refineries work, how pumpjacks work to the point as if I'm visiting it. Do the same for those industries that I care so much about, like ethanol, steel and cement. Do the same for a solar plant like Andasol.

I guess I wanted to learn about automation is to know if I can build my own factory/plant. If I can, and if I know how professional stuff are done there, I can out source it effectively, and at the same time manage the money flow too.

Also see how can solar panels are mass produced, what are the remaining challenges, (or any). Also see whether it will solve the electricity problem in full (meaning I can clearly see a path, and measure progress on that path) as I thought it would. If not then I'll have to reevaluate my plan

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year

How about the science left to do with Lithium and Lithium ion batteries?

And again, look into creating several startup types, one being manufacturing, one being industrial, one being web service, one being biochemical engineering.

Familiarize myself with permits and environmental regulations that are floating around in the world right now.

To understand the supply chain and how can I affect it, look for ways to mitigate palm oil.

"climate change without bullshit". Important article to go through: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/7/17306008/climate-change-global-warming-scenarios-ambition

Dig into the quick history of human kind. Possibly watching Origins again

Kickstarter: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7lzqyo/anyone_have_experience_with_kickstarter_tips/

Also intro to family planning and those kind of stuff, and investigate the claim made by drawdown

In light of drawdown, how about I discuss it with a lot of people, hold conferences at many different places and also change the textbook?

get into the mining and petrochemical industry. Also play satisfactory to begin to appreciate the size of these industrial machines, also the interconnections between them. https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/satisfactory/home. Did so, but it seems like this view of full automation is kind of misleading, because in the real world, we do not have the freedom of picking up factories and ploping them down. We have a preconceived idea of how the factory is structured, how things move in and out, and there is typically only 1 main assembling line. Other improvements are about efficiency, speed-wise. So it's really, really different from the type of scaling in satisfactory or in factorio.

what I understand now is that a plant can just spring up easily, and I mean really easily. The real barrier is the government and the market. But like, I need to study to the point where I can that whole facility by myself then study about the market and the government.

i guess what i am looking for is "manufacturing and supply chain", which nha's books kinda gives me the foundations

how stuff works in life in general: https://www.artofmanliness.com/tag/heading-out-on-your-own/

archicad

oh wow, this is such a gem about manufacturing and prototyping: https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-parts-injection-molding

okay, so I got the heavy industries down. I know what machines are there, how do these pieces fit together. Now see the same for the semiconductor industry, and what's the deal with all of those substrates, the doping and the etching? Also how metal working works, and how foundaries work too. For this, may be look for yt channels like king of random or night hawk

some recycling stats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxaN_xqQh4

so I guess what I wanted to do about climate through all of these investigation might be giving out suggestions to improve stuff

Manufacturing:
- "reddit industrial machine design process"
- I still don't know how to build a factory from scratch tho, so still make an effort to dig into it
- also should I get involved in the manufacturing business?
- also what software do they use for monitoring automated stuff? Probably a course in automation will do it
- profile sinarmas
- also how oil products are refined
- how electricity in industrial systems work?

also see over how public talking works, what venues I can penetrate into

how waste management works
also how to futureproof myself
how to contract out for a whole factory?
so the guts of mechanical engineering is to be damn precise and to be rigid

about the climate stuff. What resources do I have an infinite amount of that I can rely on? I have been taking electricity for granted

may be getting back into the finite element analysis thing if I have time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txk-VO1hzBY

for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

read the 14 pages of the green new deal
also metals scarcity seems to be a thing too. So dig into that
the art of not being governed: an anarchist history of upland southeast asia, james scott

Global climate action summit (9 hours long summit lol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxHDD_pLf0
also go through all of practical engineering to get the feel for the field
so as a test of building big things, see how wind turbines are built and how 1 guy can do that
also see how can you program those huge robot arms from japan

also, may be go over really quickly the economic vids on khan academy, they have a lot of content and possibly gems that I can utilize

and then finish the freakonomics book. Why do I feel like that book is kinda more anecdotal and won't actually introduce to the big picture.

what's the deal with chemtrails?

how water works, mesopotamia, 691 BCE

how about something like factorio, but much deeper, requiring much more effort, containing a lot more content. But this time it will be simpler. I'm imagining something like an industry simulator

also materials science? May be learn 3-4 courses in that

International Sea Level Institute.
Sanan Sino-Science, chinese comp that plant trees in doors, price 11 times higher than the market average. No pescitides needed, and not much water needed too

Also dig into hydroponics and aquaponics

again, I feel that econ stuff is so "floating". I don't know where their absolute zero is. But I suspect that no one actually know how it works and just follow with the flow. Also, spend some time writing about how problems in Factorio differ from logistic problems in real life

Again, try to make an ASIC, application specific integrated circuits. Try to get myself to the cutting edge of these circuits and systems.

- try out the organic stuff at autodesk
- then the story of energy

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too

get into the current resolution capability of earth, and see over that project to image the black hole shit. Like, I know that they are using that regenerative algorithm shit in order to reconstruct the full image, like the technique used in MRI. So, dig into all of physics, up to what I've known about particle physics so far, then a bunch of simulations to carry out. Then simulate this regenerative algorithm shit. Kinda getting into the high tech for a moment. After that, surely I will have a bigger picture on global warming shits.

methane stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62VXwjT-csQ

esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

Also I still don't get the interface for climate change. I mean, the common technical language ppl talk with each other in the field, so dig into that.

wtf is this https://americas.ramboll.com/projects

also I feel like I need to study physics rigorously now, with the state of mind that I've got

quickly go through everything here: http://www.worldscienceu.com/

read more about how these molecules are formed, then simulate that

Then read over those 2000 pages magento, then understand the existing apis for the big picture.

Also look over the internal documents to see if there's something fun.

stocks again, check out docs for robinhood

"Two-line element set (TLE)", insanely popular data format used to describe satellite orbits

see over chi's new lab reports and understand the chemistry she's currently involved in.

an interesting challenge that I think will be in the right step to understand the true solutions to climate change would be to do the terraformed mars thing, or at least look into casey's work and figure out how it works. Then use the data available for earthquakes and other stuff like tree tops, aggregated from satellites and whatnot to visualize and put together all of these data.

also a problem with money and law that I think I need to solve is that currently I'm kinda not using the legal library as the rest of the world. I need to know the details, to be aware of the parameters that introduces

so, priorities now (if meanwhile i got crazy because of the pressure, play factorio to get the scaling challenges, then may be walk and listen to those irregular podcasts, like anthropocene reviewed):
- get the mola mars data (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter), then fill 'em up with water, to probe at the actual scale of a planet, then try to read over casey's work to see how he does his simulation
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then do actual simulations of cfd
- see how those folks aggregating data do it. At this point, I should have an idea of how this is like, with the mola plan above, so this will be sort of a best practice kind of approach. Candidate starting point would be that p5.js sketch thing, with the earthquake data, and also the website that aggregate deforestation information
- then see over other nasa's dataset, preferably about earth and start to dive deep into the current state of climate stuff, because I still don't entirely get it
