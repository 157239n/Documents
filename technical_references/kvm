also easy kvm manipulation? Like, just resize the screen automatically if I forces the outside screen to a corner. Also look up the beneath window for dpi and resolution information

"desktop window manager using gpu"

try spice, and plug a new comp directly into a gpu this time
I mean, like, there's another option. Still use the best CPU spice implementation, and GPU for rendering, then push that to cpu and then to spice? Cause that seems like the only way you can have a screen within another screen
