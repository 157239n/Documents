this is for all of the interesting reactions from seablock, a factorio mod

ores seem to require sulfuric acid a lot
metals like manganese seem to transform to cathode/anode, so see what's up

H2O -> green algae, brown algae
green algae -> fiber
brown algae -> alginic acid
alginic acid, fiber -> pulp
silicon ore, lime -> cement
LiCl, H2O -> LiClO4, H2
LiClO4, LiCoO2, carbon -> lithium ion battery | lithium cobalt oxide is the cathode
steel plate, carbon -> electrolyser electrode | this happens??

algae liquefaction, blue algae liquefaction, thermal water
flotation cell, hydro refining
nitrogen processing 2
chlorine processing 2
sulfur processing 2
sulfur processing 3
resin 1
synthesis gas processing
smelting 3

---------------

100 water -> 30 oxygen, 40 hydrogen???
100 purified water -> 40 oxygen, 60 hydrogen??? Why the mass imbalance? May be just for the game's sake

2H2O -> O2 + 2H2
2 * 18 -> 32, 4 (1 O2, 2 H2) 
2 mole water -> 1 mole oxygen, 2 mole hydrogen

There is no fucking reason that more hydrogen would be produced

---------------

CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2, makes sense

---------------

LiCl + 4 H2O -> LiClO4 + 4 H2

makes sense that there's a lot of water and hydrogen. Still don't make sense the correct ratio tho

---------------

4 NaOH -> 4 Na + 2 H2O + O2

amounts sort of make sense, but not entirely

---------------

Na2SO4 -> Na + S

doesn't really make sense, so see what's up

---------------

NaOH + charcoal + N2 -> carbon + NaCO3 + H2O

where does the nitrogen goes??

---------------

CH3OH --green catalyst--> CH2O
real: CH3OH + 0.5 O2 --silver+iron--> CH2O + H2O

green catalyst is made from aluminum and silver btw, so kinda checks out

---------------

CO + 2 H2 --green catalyst--> CH3OH

---------------

CH3OH + CO + H2O -> CH3COOH
real:
CH3OH + HI -> CH3I + H2O
CH3I + CO -> CH3COI
CH3COI + H2O -> CH3COOH + HI

---------------

Cl2 + CH4 -> CH3Cl
real (?): Cl2 + CH4 -> CH3Cl + HCl

where is my HCl lol

another real reaction: CH3OH + HCl -> CH3Cl + H2O

---------------

NaOH + Cl2 -> NaClO
real: 2NaOH + Cl2 -> NaCl + NaClO + H2O

---------------

NaCl + H2O -> NaOCl + H2, endothermic

---------------

oil stuff: gasoline -> naphtha -> kerosene -> diesel -> heavy oil -> residue
another desc: petrol -> naphtha -> kerosene -> diesel -> bitumen/asphalt
heavier elements need more processing (steam cracking) before they can be useful

also, petroleum gas seems to be exactly the same as gasoline

reforming: increase amount of gasoline produced
blending: mixes different refinery products to make finished petroleum fuels
treating: produce cleaner gasoline
