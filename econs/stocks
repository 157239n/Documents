companies have 2 ways of financing:
- borrow money: "debt financing"
- sell stock: "equity financing"

3 big stock exchanges in the US:
- NYSE: New York Stock Exchange
- AMEX: American Stock Exchange
- NASDAQ: National Association of Securities Dealers

"All publicly traded companies need to issue quarterly earnings reports through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If those earnings are lackluster, shareholders might decide to sell some of their stock, which would lower the stock price. But if the newspaper reports an overall increase in the popularity of pizza, more people might buy shares and the price would go back up."

"You can't sell stock in the company unless you become a corporation." The process is called "incorporated"

A corporation:
- is a "virtual person"
- has its own SSN, called federal tax ID number
- can own property
- can sue and make contracts (can also be sued)
- limit liabilities of owners

laws are in place to dictate:
- how a corporation operates
- how it's organized
- how shareholders and the public get protection

The board:
- must have in a corporation
- determined by shareholder meeting each year
- makes the decisions for the company. Like:
  - number of shares to be issued to the public
- hires everyone else (officers: president and other major officers of the company)
- set company's policies

"The main reason that companies choose to issue stock to the public is to raise a large quantity of investment capital quickly through an IPO. The corporation might sell 1 mil shares of stock at $20 a share to raise $20mil in a short amount of time"

If the corporation chooses to pay an annual dividend, then shareholders will receive a cut of the profits every year.
Most likely in young companies they issue "growth stocks", in which all of the profits are reinvested. If the shareholder holds onto a growth stock for long enough, he could eventually sell it for a significant gain.

Mysterious numbers:
- Dow Jones Industrial Average: average of the value of 30 large American stocks, plus any stock splits
- S&P 500: average value of 500 of these large companies
- Nasdaq Composite Index: average of all stocks listed on the nasdaq exchange

As an investor, you have several options for buying or selling stock. There are dozens of companies that are authorized to trade with the major US stock exchanges and even foreign exchanges like the Tokyo or London Stock Exchanges. If you call an "investment house" like Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley, they will connect you to a stockbroker who can make your trades for a fee (online then $7/trade).
