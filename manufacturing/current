oh wow, this is such a gem about manufacturing and prototyping: https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/how-design-parts-injection-molding

Manufacturing:
- "reddit industrial machine design process"
- I still don't know how to build a factory from scratch tho, so still make an effort to dig into it
- also should I get involved in the manufacturing business?
- also what software do they use for monitoring automated stuff? Probably a course in automation will do it
- profile sinarmas
- also how oil products are refined
- how electricity in industrial systems work?

i guess what i am looking for is "manufacturing and supply chain", which nha's books kinda gives me the foundations

I guess I wanted to learn about automation is to know if I can build my own factory/plant. If I can, and if I know how professional stuff are done there, I can out source it effectively, and at the same time manage the money flow too.
