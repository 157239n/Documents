Manufacturing:
- "reddit industrial machine design process"
- I still don't know how to build a factory from scratch tho, so still make an effort to dig into it
- also should I get involved in the manufacturing business?
- also what software do they use for monitoring automated stuff? Probably a course in automation will do it
- profile sinarmas
- also how oil products are refined
- how electricity in industrial systems work?
