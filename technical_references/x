for x server and stuff

so, there're a fuckton of different stuff, all very confusing:
- window manager: awesome, compiz, i3
- desktop environment: xfce, kde plasma
- display manager: lightdm. Apparently, this is the login part before entering a desktop environment

display managers are sort of "tied" to desktop environments. Like, kdm for kde plasma, gdm for gnome, lightdm for xfce. Apparently, you can "launch gnome with lightdm", so I guess the lightdm stuff is pretty insignificant?

ssh -X <address>, then open a GUI, and that gui will appear in the current window. Pretty cool

lightdm stopped, but I can still do stuff? Right, so that just kills the login screen, but X is still running in tty1, and I have already logged in, so that doesn't really matter. When I kill X directly, that kills tty1's x, so that makes sense. Interesting thing is, when I enable lightdm, tty7 shows up
