goals for ML systems going forward?
- document everything as deliverable posts
- recognizes general trends from hyperparam search
- 1 experiment/day seems proper. This will help me to plan for the future as well, and create pressure to make the entire pipeline fast

task: char name classification (50% acc, 0.8 loss is possible)
- bigru approach, understand underlying C++ codebase
task: progressive deepening
- high-res gan stuff. This should verify learning dynamics at later times (think: blind cat)

also, try to apply attention stuff to that gravity prediction problem earlier. Have a great feeling this will work

----------- for later

- migrate blackbox posts to mlexps
- try to do conv5 in blackbox series, so that all linear operations are effectively merged together
