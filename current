so, priorities now:
- do the dora todo list thing, for gems about computational fluid dynamics (and navier stokes obviously) and whatnot
- then the story of energy post
- read rocket propulsion elements
- read understanding earth: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo-1/Downloads/John%20Grotzinger,%20Thomas%20H.%20Jordan,%20Frank%20Press,%20Raymond%20Siever%20-%20Understanding%20Earth%205th%20Ed..pdf
- (low priority) Learn about some fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, for understanding the applicability of science
- Switch major to mechanical engineering, and get into a machine/hardware shop. Ask for contacts for students that are actually building hardware products for customers, from scratch. I remember Khue's friend used to do that.

Additional heating over last decade: 8*10^21 Joules per year, 3M exajoules/year, plants capture 3k exajoules/yr, human activities 500 exajoules/yr
467kWh - 1.2tr
for the long future, again, dyson swarm and solar panels on orbit

american: 45kg CO2/day

also, space-based solar panels seems reasonable, but still harder (20 times harder, my gut feeling), so it's reasonable only if we want to build a civilization in the stars, and not as a means to transition earth, I mean, that would be kinda dumb. So sort of read over the us military's report on space access, also that environment report, with cleanrooms and whatnot, to get the feel of the possibility to actually do these kinds of things

general tso's, lo mein, see places where I can eat that, then invite dan & chi? May be jsut go around and try them myself

so how about I go out, register for a credit card, to then build up a strong credit score that I can use in the future?

how about private international law (aka international business law). It seems more complicated than the public one. I think I have understood the public ones enough already

prepare ideas for that lib guy

check over my health insurance

see how coupons work in heirloom

"stores and rewards cards", and "rewards credit card", 1-5% back in cash/points. Dig more into this. Is this just a normal credit card, or is it a specific card for a specific store: https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/are-credit-card-rewards-worth-it

ask chi about switchable mechanically interlocked macromolecular architectures (MIMA) and like, I sort of want to know what's available now

data from aukehostra. Not necessarily have to build programs to scratch through this, but to get the idea of how things are like, aka status update

read Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, just to take in the concrete ideas of UBI? Reviews said that the latter half is good

yeah let's go on sunday 10pm, for that thing, because on friday there's minh and on sat there's the competition. Also bring food for her

7. joints, fastenings and people - also about creep and chariot wheels
8. soft materials and living structures - or how to design a worm
9. walls, arches and dams - or cloud towers and the stability of masonry
10. something about bridges - or saint... and saint...
11. advantage of being a beam - with observations on roofs, trusses, and masts
12. mystery of shear and torsion - or polaris and the bias-cut nightie
13. the various ways of failing in compression - or sandwiches, skulls, and dr euler
14. philosophy of design - or the shape, the weight and the cost
15. chapter of accidents - a study in sin, error, and metal fatigue
16. efficiency and aesthetic - or the world we have to live in

go over ML models and see if I can have some information extraction process out of stocks and whatnot. That link by ynes again seems nice and all that. And really get into the data and make this a dependable skillset
