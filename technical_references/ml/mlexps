goals for ML systems going forward?
- document everything as deliverable posts
- recognizes general trends from hyperparam search
- 1 experiment/day seems proper. This will help me to plan for the future as well, and create pressure to make the entire pipeline fast

task: style transfer
- see if modifying images over time have different internal dynamics than normal training
task: char name classification (50% acc, 0.8 loss is possible)
- bigru approach, understand underlying C++ codebase
task: progressive deepening
- high-res gan stuff. This should verify learning dynamics at later times (think: blind cat)
random:
- graph nn

also, train a really long network (with skip blocks), then throw out middle layers, to see if everything still works as intended. How about if I do this fast and switch it back and forth. Will the middle layers then want to pass signals through as much as possible?

also, try to apply attention stuff to that gravity prediction problem earlier. Have a great feeling this will work
