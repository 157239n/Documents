zpool create -o ashift=12 test raidz2 /tmp/*.raw
	"/tmp/*.raw" can be a list of devices "/dev/sda /dev/sdb"
zpool destroy <pool>
zpool status [<pool>]
zfs list [<pool>]


after creating a pool, can create a volume in it like this:
	zfs create mypool/mydataset
	zfs set quota=1T mypool/mydataset

or, creating a logical volume (no idea how this is different from the above) like this:
	zfs create -V 20G mypool/myzvol
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/zvol/mypool/myzvol
zvols are sort of like a dataset, but it's just a block device and you have to install a file system on it
