see over IMF's publications, like "World economic outlook"

apparently each country has 1 "central bank" that controls every other banks

so, apparently, money supply have to increase, to make the economy more dynamic. If we don't have inflation then paper money would just be limited in scope just like commodity money. So the aim is to increase the money reserve to go along with the growing supply of value. 2% to 3% annually is good, it keeps prices stable. Unemployment rates requirements are low too, like 5%

good thought experiment

so the setup is like this: 1 Venmo dollar (VM) at time 0 equals to 1 USD. In everyone's mind, the value of the 2 is exactly the same
Trader A has a bunch of VM bills, and he is willing to trade 1 VM bill for 1.1 USD. He also has other jobs in the VM world to replenish the supply of VM he has. Trader A is convinced USD is worth a bit more, so he won't give away any USD
Trader B has a bunch of USB bills, and she is willing to trade 1 USD bill for 1.1 VM (effectively 1 VM for 0.9 USD). She also has other jobs to replenish the supply of USD she has. Trader B is convinced VM to worth a bit more, so she won't give away any VM

So now, if someone wants to convert between VM to USD, then he/she should do business with trader B, because she values VM more, and is willing to give away USD.
If someone wants to convert between USD to VM, then he/she should do business with trader A, because he values USD more.

all consumers have nothing, yet

traders, before switch:
- A: 1 VM = 1.1 USD, willing to give out VM. Has 100 VM, equivalent to 100 apples
- B: 1 VM = 0.9 USD, willing to give out USD. Has 100 USD, equivalent to 100 apples
- C: 1 apple = 0.9 VM, willing to give out apples. Has 100 apples, equivalent to 100 apples
- D: 1 apple = 1.1 VM, willing to give out VM. Has 100 VM, equivalent to 100 apples
- E: 1 apple = 0.9 USD, willing to give out apples. Has 100 apples, equivalent to 100 apples
- F: 1 apple = 1.1 USD, willing to give out USD. Has 100 USD, equivalent to 100 apples

traders, after switch:
- A: 1 VM = 2.1 USD, willing to give out VM. Has 100 VM, equivalent to 200 apples
- B: 1 VM = 1.9 USD, willing to give out USD. Has 100 USD, equivalent to 100 apples
- C: 2 apple = 0.9 VM, willing to give out apples. Has 100 apples, equivalent to 100 apples
- D: 2 apple = 1.1 VM, willing to give out VM. Has 100 VM, equivalnt to 200 apples
- E: 1 apple = 0.9 USD, willing to give out apples. Has 100 apples, equivalent to 100 apples
- F: 1 apple = 1.1 USD, willing to give out USD. Has 100 apples, equivalent to 100 apples

question is, will traders A-F and consumers 1-3 be all satisfied?
