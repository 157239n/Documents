xdebug, php extension for remote debugging, code coverange, and more

php7.4-xml
php7.4-mbstring

so unit, integration and functional

that alcohol thingy

dependencies that needs to be ironed out:
- global variables. This is solved using dependency injection
- session variables. This is solved again, using dependency injection and mocking the session variables
- usage of registry. Slightly different way of accessing global variables
- other code

- unit
- integration
- functional

$this->getMock('\Util\Mail');

set_error_handler() and set_exception_handler() function levels
$this->fail()
$this->markTestIncomplete('...')
$this->markTestSkipped('...')
\PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase

cli capabilities:
- running tests
- processing test results
- configuring options
- generating code coverage

test statuses:
- .: success
- F: fail
- E: error
- S: skipped
- I: incomplete

Imagick::readImage

- test fixtures
- global state
- test dependencies
- data providers

known state for tests:
- known state for methods
- known state for classes

in a single class, setUp() and tearDown() is used for wrapping around methods
then setUpBeforeClass() and tearDownAfterClass()

phpunit offers configuration options to switch global variables backup on or off. Can be done in CLI, text config file (phpunit.xml) or in code (@backupGlobals disabled)
@depends <method name>

organize tests using config file:
- test suites
- groups included or excluded from execution

so, I can do something like don't have namespaces for classes at all, and only reference the autoloader thingy

- Dummy: only accepting arguments
- Fake: immitate real object's functionality
- Stub: return predefined values
- Spy: like stub, but remembers
- Mock: stub with expectations
