Forests: 30% of the world's land area (1.5 * 10^8 km^2), 2/3 of which are from these countries:
- Russia
- Brazil, best (years of)
- Canada
- United States
- China
- Australia
- Congo
- Indonesia, worst (years of)
- Peru
- India

"20 percent of all emissions come from deforestation", same as all transportation on the planet.

Deforestation rate:
- 1.37 * 10^5 km^2. Greece, or 1/3 of Germany
- 0.1% of the world's land area
- 0.3% of the world's forests

boreal forst = taiga

Rates here, but old https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation_2000-2005.html:
Negative continents: Africa, South America, Oceania, North America
Positive continents: Europe, Asia

Absolute rates:
- Russia
- Brazil
- Canada
- US
- Indonesia

But only commodity driven deforestation matters. Russia has lots of wildfires, other industrialized countries lose trees to forestry, which is sustainable. So to that note, Indonesia is actually quite, quite bad. Also Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.

Russia, China, North America has lots of wildfires btw
