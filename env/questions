Wait hold up, my house is 48 m^2, power is 45W/m^2, so total power is 2160W. But 125kWh per day per person, so 5200W per person, which is problematic. So how does solar works for other households?

So Tim Siftar thinks that nuclear isn't an option. I cited France, he said that France pays a whole lot for subsidies to keep the plants running. Is it really that bad?
