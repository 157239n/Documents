- RD-191: familiar, high performance staged combustion cycle
- RD-68A: highest thrust to weight of H2/O2 engine, advanced gas generator cycle
- RD-0124: upper stage engine, 4 thrust chambers, 1 turbopump

Propulsion devices:
- (chemical nuclear solar). D/P: developed, practical. TFD: technical feasibility demonstrated. TFND: technical feasibility not demonstrated
- (D/P) Turbojet
- (TFD) Turbo-ramjet
- (D/P TFD) Ramjet (hydrocarbon)
- (TFD) Ramjet (H2 cooled)
- (D/P TFD) Rocket
- (TFD) Ducted rocket
- (D/P . D/P) Electric rocket
- (. TFD) Nuclear fission rocket
- (. . TFD) Solar-heated rocket
- (. TFND) Photon rocket
- (. . TFD) Solar sail

Criterias:
- Thrust to weight ratio
- Specific fuel consumption (lbs of prop per hour per lbs of thrust, which tbh sounds like specific impulse)
- Specific thrust (N/m^2)
- Specific impulse (thrust per unit prop or fuel weight flow per sec)
- Thrust change with altitude
- Thrust vs. flight speed
- Thrust vs. air temperature
- Flight speed vs. exhaust velocity
- Altitude limitation

So, ramjets are jets with subsonic combustion, while scramjets are jets with supersonic combustion

Definitions:
- Total impulse (It): int 0->t F * dt. Thrust force integrated over the time of its application t. Constant thrust, then I = F * t. Have same units as momentum. Is proportional to total energy of the reaction
- Specific impulse (Is): thrust per unit propellant "weight" flow rate. Is = It / (g0 * int 0->t mdot dt), g0 being earth's gravitational constant of 9.8. Time-averaged specific impulse in seconds. Useful when thrust varies with time. For short time intervals, Is = It / (mp * g0)
