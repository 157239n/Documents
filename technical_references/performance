10700k, advertised performance: 30 GFLOPS/core

practical performance:
C loop, dummy sum: 0.6 GFLOPS
Python loop, dummy sum: 12 MFLOPS
C loop, buffered writes: 0.1 GFLOPS
Python loop, np buffered writes: 0.1 GFLOPS

expectations:
- 50x less performance than advertised, for C
- 50x less performance than C, for Python

sequence alignment:
- 18%, 82s
