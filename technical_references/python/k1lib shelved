MemoryProfiler, run for multiple batches, to see the ups and down, and to detect memory leaks.

write tutorial about cli.ctx

document graphEqn, and show examples where it's useful

rename to gE again, and have something like gE(a = gE.Var()), so that variable names can be captured. Also do the multiple expression thingy, may be .also(). The vision is to just multiply stuff at will, then check a visualization graph to see how many source variables are left. Then we can manually set those, and every value will just pop into life!

upload graphEqn lol
