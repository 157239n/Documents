"Small modular reactors", these are nuclear reactors, but are just small and can be cranked out pretty wild. 10-50MW. Hell, the Andasol plant somewhere up there is like 50MW per huge powerplant, and they take 3 fucking years and a whole lot of fucking man hours to deploy it. Can we just do this (mass manufacturing reactors) and problemo solved? Some reactors to dig into:
- Toshiba 4S
- SSTAR, "Small, Sealed, Transportable, Autonomous Reactor". At what point does this just becomes a matter of investing in the technology like Tesla's robotaxis and let them proliferate? Also the marketing here does draw me in
- Hyperion, $25 mil per 25 MW (see the details of current electricity rates), New Mexico
- NuScale, Oregon
- Babcock & Wilcox "mPower"
- Integral Fast Reactor "ARC-100"
- TerraPower thorium reactor


"10-19 years to put up a nuclear powerplant from planning to operation. This includes about 3.5 to 6 years of site permits. 2.5 to 4 years to have construction permit. 4 to 9 years of actual construction"
In China, construction times still take 7 years for a reactor

In 2010 to 2011 there's a massive, massive drop in nuclear, just like Egypt's back in the day
