esa is the largest provider of environmental data from space in the world, thanks to copernicus, eu program, using earth observing satellites. Get this mother fucking data and dig into it.

also interesting stuff/data here: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/welcome.html and here: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. Man, the last one is a data gem. Also poking data here will make me understand about lidar stuff too
