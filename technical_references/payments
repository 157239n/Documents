i have no idea how any of these work and this is not my area of expertise

internet merchant account
payment gateway (worldpay, sage pay), sends to payment processor (whose is this?), then money from customer bank to your account
payment service provider (hosts frontend pages, offer a list of payment schemes to choose from)

paypal

"online marketplace"

may be set up a patrion account to test the flow of money?

this channel looks like a lot of content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NciOWYi1IJo

providers:
- bluesnap
- emerchantpay
- shift4
- judopay

payment service provider/payment processing company (worldpay)
-------------------------
payment gateway | payment processor | merchant account (imply bank)
       ^                 |
       |                 v
       |         uses visa's network
       |
integrates with erp/accounting software (sitecore)

shopify, bigcommerce, magento, woocommerce

payment processors:
- payline
- paypal
- stripe, developer-centric
- square

again, a lot of ppl is recommending transferwise

okay, so how does something like venmo changes the model? Does the guys at halal have to sign up for a merchant account? Or they can just do a normal account and let venmo just be the middleman?
